    "text": "György Klapka\n\nGyörgy (Móric) Klapka, also known in German as Georg Klapka (7 April 182017 May 1892) was a Hungarian general. He was one of the most important Hungarian generals of the Hungarian War of Independence of 1848-1849, politician, member of the Hungarian Parliament, and deputy War Minister.\n\nKlapka was born at Temesvár, Kingdom of Hungary on 6 April 1820 in a German-speaking family of Moravian origin. His ancestors migrated there from Moravia during the reign of Joseph II (1780-1790) his grandfather founding military pharmacies during the Austro-Turkish War of 1787–1791. In the following decades the families prestige grew, and György Klapka's father, József Klapka, became the mayor of Temesvár for nearly 15 years, being elected for two times deputy in the Hungarian Diet, being later ennobled by the king. His mother was Júlia Kehrer.\n\nDespite of his Moravian origin Klapka considered himself a Hungarian. He made his education at the Roman Catholic secondary schools from Kecskemét and Szeged, then he studied in the military school of Karánsebes. His father sent him to Vienna where he served in the Hungarian Nobiliary Royal Bodyguards (Magyar királyi nemesi testőrség), then in the Guards of Vienna, where he became friend with Artúr Görgei. He was an artillery Lieutenant in 1847, when he retired, and returned to Hungary. Here he was sent as lieutenant to the Border Region Division, but soon he disarmed. In 1847 he thought to go to India and to become an officer in the army of one of the Indian kings, but hearing the news about the revolution from Paris from February 1848 he decided to remain in Hungary.\n\nAfter the victory, on 15 March, of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, Klapka volunteered in the Hungarian army, and he was conscripted as Captain.\nIn May 1848 he was appointed by Batthyány Government with two Hungarian officers to go to Kolozsvár and in the Székely Land to find out if Transylvania want to reunite with Hungary, and to measure how many from the Székely border guard units can be sent to Hungary. In 13 June he is appointed as a Captain to the 16 Hungarian Battalion in Veszprém. Starting with August he joins the Hungarian military operations in Bácska (Southern Hungary) against the Serbian insurgents. \n\nIn 25 September he is sent to be the temporary director of the fortification works of the fortress of Komárom, called the \"Gibraltar of the Danube\". During that time he prevented Wilhelm Mertz, the constable of the fortress, to deliver it in the hands of the Habsburgs, and played a role in forcing Mertz and the officers loyals to the Habsburgs, to leave Komárom, securing this very important stronghold for Hungary. From 16 October 1848 Klapka supervised also the fortification works from Pozsony. During that time, as the commander of the concentrated Hungarian national guards, he participate in the military operations against the Austrian troops led by Balthasar von Simunich which broke into Hungary from Moravia. \n\nIn 13 November he is appointed chief of general staff of the Bánság army corps, and together with general Antal Vetter, he elaborates a plan to crush the Serbian insurgency, but this plan fails because its weak execution by the main commander of the military operations: general Ernő Kiss. In the end of December 1848 he works in the general staff section of the Hungarian Ministry of Defence.\n\nWhen in December 1848 the main Austrian imperial troops led by Field Marshal Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz attacked Hungary, he is appointed as Major in the Hungarian army, by 9 January 1849 he is already a Colonel. Together with his chief Antal Vetter he elaborates the plan of retreating the main Hungarian troops behind the Tisza river, and becomes the commander of the Upper Tisza Corps (Felső-tiszai hadtest).\nBefore this the Upper Tisza Corps was led by the Minister of War General Lázár Mészáros, who was defeated by the Austrian troops led by Lieutenant-General Franz Schlik in the Battle of Kassa. Klapka took over these beaten troops in January 1849, reorganized them, and beat Schlik in three consecutive battles at Tarcal (20 January), Bodrogkeresztúr (23 January), and Tokaj (31 January). Thanks to these victories Klapka held the Hungarian defensive line along the Tisza river, and won precious time for the Hungarian commandment to organize the counter-attack against Windisch-Grätz imperial troops. From 29 January 1849 he is under the command of Lieutenant-General Henryk Dembiński the main commander of the Hungarian armies.\nAfter their victory at 5 February 1849 in the Battle of Branyiszkó, the Upper Danube Corps led by Artúr Görgei approached to the Tisza river from North-West, menacing, together with Klapka's corps, to encircle and destroy Schlik's army. Understanding the importance of this chance, Klapka tried to convince Dembiński, to attack from the South Schlik's corps, but the latter refused, ordering Klapka to retreat. This wrong decision of the main commander enabled Schlik to escape the danger, and to retreat. Klapka defeated him again in 8 February at Hidasnémeti, but the Austrian general was able to retreat towards West, joining the main imperial troops led by Windisch-Grätz.\n\nKlapka participated at 26-27 February in the Battle of Kápolna, commanding the right wing of the Hungarian army at Verpelét. The battle was lost because of Dembiński's poor army leading and indecision. After Dembiński's order of retreat, at 1 March Klapka fought successful rearguard actions against the Austrian corps led by Ladislaus von Wrbna at Egerfarmos.\n\nAt 3 March he joins the revolt at Tiszafüred of the Hungarian officers dissatisfied with Dembiński's leadership, and force him to resign, supporting Görgei's election to the main commandment. \n\nFor his victories against Schlik he receives the 2d Class Hungarian Military Decoration.\n\nAt 28 March, only 29, he received the rank of General. \n\nKlapka elaborated the plan of the Spring Campaign of the Hungarian army, which will bring in the end of May, after a series of victories, the liberation of almost all Hungary from the Austrian armies. The plans main purpose was to distract the attention of the Austrian commanders with the attack from the North of the VII Corps, while the other three corps (I, II, III) had to march undetected from South and to attack from the flank the main Austrian troops stationed at Gödöllő. But unfortunately Klapka was the one who, unwillingly revealed the plan to the enemy, as it follows. Initially the victory of the Hungarian VII Corps led by András Gáspár against Schlik in the Battle of Hatvan at 2 April, deceived Windisch-Grätz to think that the attack of the Hungarian forces will come from that direction. But the failed attack of Klapka's I corps against the Austrian I Corps led by Josip Jelačić in the first phase of the Battle of Tápióbicske (he sent his troops in the city without scouting before that, to see if any enemy troops are in there, thus his troops were ambushed by an enemy infantry and a cavalry brigade), forced the III corps led by János Damjanich to intervene, and to turn the tide of the battle - which could became a serious defeat for the Hungarians - in a victory, made the Austrian Field-Marshal suspicious, that the main Hungarian attack could come from other directions, and not from where he expected that. But Jelačić's report, who, because of his vanity, wrote to Windisch-Grätz that his troops won the battle of Tápióbicske, deceived him, to think that the Croatian general was attacked only by minor Hungarian forces, so he still was not sure from where to expect the enemies attack. Furthermore, Windisch-Grätz was informed about the attack of a Hungarian detachment, on 24 March against Losonc, which took prisoner half of the 500-600 strong Austrian detachment, making him to think that important Hungarian troops will attack also from the North-East. \nBut Klapka's attack made Windisch-Grätz aware of a danger coming from South, and this can be considered his error. \n\nIn the Battle of Isaszeg from 6 April, the first decisive battle of the Spring Campaign, after initial successes, Klapka's I Corps were pushed back by Jelačić's superior forces, which made Klapka to waver, and to think seriously to retreat from the battlefield, letting Damjanich's III Corps alone, but the arrival of Görgei, and his order to resist at all costs, then the arrival of the II Corps led by Lajos Aulich, convinced him to remain and fight. At the end of the battle Klapka's I corps charge chased the enemy from Isaszeg and brought the victory for the Hungarians. The fluctuating behavior of Klapka during the battle showed that despite of being a good strategist, creating good operation plans, which enabled, in the Spring Campaign, to defeat the superior imperial troops (55,000 Austrians against 47,500 Hungarians), he could be hesitating in their execution. During the battle of Isaszeg Damjanich criticized Klapka of being too timorous and sensible to the complaints of his soldiers, instead of being resolute and determined, a quality necessary for every successful general. Luckily the main commander of \"Army of the Upper Danube\" (Feldunai Hadsereg) was Görgei, who was the most able Hungarian general to carry out Klapka's plans, and he led the army in the best way, being able to take quickly the correct decisions after short thinking, being very determined in his decisions, showing no hesitation even before the most unexpected situations, and thanks to this the Hungarian army emerged victorious in the Spring Campaign.\n\nThe second phase of the campaign was elaborated not by Klapka but by the chief of the general staff, József Bayer. During this phase of the Spring Campaign Klapka took part in the Battle of Nagysalló (19 April), playing a leading role in that victory, in the same way as in the relief of Komárom (26 April).\n\nAt 30 April 1849 he was named deputy War Minister substituting Görgei, who was leading the Siege of Buda (04-21 May 1849). Quite in the first day in his office in Debrecen Klapka had a conflict with Sándor Petőfi, the Hungarian national poet, then a major in the \"Army of Transylvania\" under the command of Lieutenant General Józef Bem. The cause of the conflict was the article written by Petőfi in the newspaper \"Honvéd\", in which he published a letter of Bem against general Károly Vécsey, accusing the latter of high treason, cowardice and incapacity, because he did not helped Bem in his failed attempt to capture the fortress of Temesvár. Hearing about this Klapka and also other Hungarian generals, who were on Vécsey's side, accused Petőfi of being undisciplined, dressing not accordingly to a soldier, besmirching the Hungarian army to the public, thus weakening the will of the nation to fight against the enemy.\n\nKlapka was angered on Petőfi also because the poet's former conflicts with other Hungarian officers and war ministers like Lieutenant General Antal Vetter and Lieutenant General Lázár Mészáros (against whom he wrote also a satirical poem), so he dumped on the poet, who came to the war office to ask for permission to go to the freshly liberated Pest, to bury his father. At the end of the quarrel, seeing that Klapka would not allow him to go, Petőfi declared that he resigns from his military title and quits the army. After this, thinking that now he is liberated from all military discipline rules, Petőfi wrote a letter to Klapka, declaring that he cannot bear the offenses from Klapka, which offended his dignity, and wrote a poem entitled \"Egy goromba tábornokra\" (About a Rude General), in which he named Klapka an unworthy man and a weak general. Klapka prosecuted Petőfi for this, and when he met him at 14 May at Pest, he arrested the poet. Petőfi was saved by General Görgei, whose favorite poet he was, liberating him from the arrest, sending a deputation made of officers to ask for pardon from Klapka in the name of Petőfi.\n\nIn the middle of May 1849, the news about the upcoming Russian intervention spread throughout Hungary, and the need to take measure against this grave danger, became imminent. The enemy had a huge numerical advantage against the Hungarian army: the attacking Russian and Austrian armies had 358 000 soldiers (plus other 75 000 soldiers in Galicia and Walachia in reserve) and 770 cannons against 150 000 Hungarian soldiers with 440 cannons. \n\nIn the second part of May, Klapka was designated to elaborate the united operation plan of all the armies from Hungary. According to this operation plan the main army under Görgei had to defend the Western border, while the army of Transylvania under Józef Bem had to defend mountain passes in the Eastern Carpathians, but in the same time he had to crush also the Romanian revolt from the Western Carpathians, to take the fortresses of Gyulafehérvár and Déva, then to attack towards West, taking the Titel Plateau, liberating Pétervárad, then advancing to the Adriatic Sea, or to the Western front. Although it was accepted by the Ministry Council from 20 May, this operation plan was met with harsh critics from Görgei and Bem, who accused it with no concern to the imminent Russian intervention which menaced from North and from East, and that Lieutenant General Bem and General Mór Perczel had been designated to carry out military actions which exceeded their capacities, while the other Hungarian corps were condemned to almost complete inactivity. Bem declared that he will not carry out the military actions entailed on him by this operation plan, and he will remain in Transylvania to defend it from the imminent Russian attack, while Görgei said that the only correct thing to do in this grave situation, is to immediately attack with all forces on the Western front towards Vienna, to crush the Austrian army before the Russians could intervene. As the result of these reactions and the start of the Russian intervention in 15 June 1849, the operation plan elaborated by Klapka was not carried out. \n\nIn June, when Görgei took over his duties in the War Ministry, Klapka substituted him in the command of the \"Army of the Upper Danube\", being entrusted, together with the chief of the general staff Colonel József Bayer, to attack the imperial forces led by Field-Marshal Julius Jacob von Haynau in the region of the Vág river, and push them towards Pozsony and Vienna, but at 16 June they were defeated by the Austrians in the battle of Zsigárd. When Görgei took over the main command, in the Battle of Pered from 20-21 June 1849, Klapka had the mission to attack with the VIII corps the Austrians in the Csallóköz, but his troops were defeated at Nyárasd, and forced to retreat. Nevertheless, at the end of the battle Klapka's troops secured the retreat of the Hungarian army, by securing the bridge from Aszódpuszta.\n\nDuring the Second Battle of Komárom of 2 July, Klapka commanded the left wing of the Hungarian army, retreating initially from Ószőny, but at the end of the battle, after fierce fighting, recaptured the important locality from the Austrian IV corps led by General Ludwig von Benedek. At the end of this battle Görgei was heavily wounded, and once again, Klapka took over the command from him, until he was again able to lead the army. During this period under the lead of Klapka, the Hungarian officers decided to oppose the decisions of the Hungarian government, which demanded the immediate retreat of the army from Komárom, and the deposition of Görgei from the commandment of the \"Army of the Upper Danube\". Klapka and the officers refused to fulfill both these orders, forcing the government to accept their decision to remain for a several days in Komárom, and to keep Görgei as their commander. At 11 July, because Görgei was still unable to lead the army, Klapka commanded the Hungarian forces in the Third Battle of Komárom. The Hungarians tried to break the Austrian blockade from the West against Komárom, but, because of the inactivity of two of the corps commanders, the battle was lost.\n\nOn 12-13 July, when, under Görgei's command, the \"Army of the Upper Danube\" retreated from Komárom to the East Klapka remained with the II and VIII corps (around 18,300 soldiers) in Komárom, having the duty to defend with all cost the fortress and to \"bind\" as many enemy troops around it, preventing them to participate in the campaign against the Hungarian armies. \nAs the captain of the encircled fortress, cut from the other Hungarian armies, Klapka decided to do a heroical fight against the superior enemy, to resist until nothing can be done, and if he would be forced to leave Komárom, he would do it only with honor and head erect. He wrote this in July:\n\n\"I say it already from now: no matter what will be the situation, we can leave this place only with honor, or we will be buried together under the crumbling ruins of this [fortress]. Long live the Fatherland, and its heroic army!\" \n\nUntil 23 July this task was fulfilled with success, forcing 28,000 imperial soldiers to secure the fortress, but then half of these troops were sent to Pest. On 25 July a Hungarian raiding unit captured a stagecoach in which they found documents containing the list of the imperial troops around Komárom, from which Klapka understood that his troops from within the fortress are more numerous than the besiegers, and because the fact that the imperial troops were positioned on the both shores of the Danube, which prevented them to help each other when attacked, he had the opportunity to defeat the enemy in detail. \nIn the night of 29-30 June Klapka sent troops on the left bank of the Danube, chasing away the Austrian troops from the North-West of Komárom. In the night of 3 August 1849, Klapka personally led the Hungarian troops to the right bank of the Danube, attacking the Austrian blockade around the fortress, crushing the imperial forces led by Lieutenant Field Marshal Anton Csorich in the Fourth Battle of Komárom, causing them 1500 casualties, capturing 30 cannons, many thousands of riffles, ammunition and an entire herd of oxens. This was the last important battle won by the Hungarians in the Hungarian War of Independence. After the battle Klapka's troops advanced towards West and occupied the city of Győr, liberating a huge territory from North Transdanubia, cutting the connection and supply lines between Vienna and the troops led by Haynau in Central Hungary. Hearing the news of this victory the citizens of Székesfehérvár revolted against the occupying Austrian forces and chased them away. Klapka started recruitment from the liberated territories, which added 5000-6000 new recruits to his troops, and planned to attack the Austrian province of Styria.\n\nBut on 11 August he received news about the disastrous situation on the other fronts, and he halted his operations. He understood that his victory came a little too late to change the fate of the Hungarian war of independence. Two days after this, at 13 August 1849, 10 days after Klapka's victory, the main Hungarian army led by Artúr Görgei surrendered in front of the Russian troops at the Szöllős Meadow near the village of Világos.\n\nKlapka, together with his 25,000 soldiers, retreated on 15 August to Komárom. On 19 August the Austrian and Russian troops arrived to the fortress and begun to encircle it, in 14 September the number of the Austrians reached 44,000 soldiers and 154 cannons, and the Russians numbered 12 000 soldiers and 56 cannons. The Austrians then the Russians too demanded the surrender of the fortress but Klapka and the Hungarian military council refused.\nThanks to the intervention in the negotiations of the Habsburg Minister of Defense Ferenc Gyulay, himself a Hungarian, on 21 August a 14 day armistice was signed, which allowed to Klapka to send four commissioners to travel across all Hungary to ascertain about the military situation in the country, and to be sure that the Hungarian army had lost the Independence War. \n\nAfter the commissioners turned back with the news of the surrender of the Hungarian armies and the majority of the fortresses, instead of deciding to surrender as well, like the Austrians and the Russians hoped, the defenders of Komárom became more combative and wanted even more than before, to continue their fight. Klapka ordered new battalions and one division to be formed, and the trenches around the fortress to be strengthened. He even founded a personal guards unit made up of grenadiers. \n\nDuring the Austro-Russian siege the Hungarian composer Béni Egressy who was in the besieged Komárom, wrote the \"Klapka March\", in honor of the general. This military march is played often also today during the military parades in Hungary. The marchs lyrics, entitled \"Fel, fel vitézek a csatára\" (Rise, Rise Soldiers to the Baattle) were written much later, in 1861, by Kálmán Thaly.\n\nAt the end of August all of the mobile Hungarian troops surrendered, as well the fortresses too, with the exception of Pétervárad, which held until 7 September. Only the fortress of Komárom refused to surrender. On 5, 7, 10, 25 and 27 September the Hungarian defenders fought with success against the enemy troops, furthermore the Hungarian Hussars executed successful sorties against the besieging army. For example, on 5 September 300 Hungarian hussars, led personally by Klapka, routed a Russian Cossack unit at Hetény.\n\nSeeing that they have no success in their attempts to take the fortress by force, the Austrians tried distraction, attempting to diminish the morale, fighting spirit and the unity of the defenders. They sent in the fortress different leaflets, fake reports, orders, which tried to persuade the defenders to treachery, to revolt, to refuse to fulfill the orders, or to desert, promising them amnesty in exchange. This method had a certain success, because the number of the desertions increased, and Klapka was forced to take more drastical measures against them. As a result, 15 Hungarian deserters were executed publicly in the main square of Komárom.\n\nThe Austrians even paid a hitman to assassinate Klapka. His name was Fehérhegyi, and allegedly he was born in New York. He was caught before he could assassinate Klapka. They found at him a letter of credence from the Austrian officer Lieutenant-Colonel Hoyos, which demonstrated that he worked for the Austrians. Fehérhegyi was sentenced to death by the martial court and executed. \n\nThe Austrians continued to send demands to surrender, and on 19 September the Hungarian military council of Komárom decided to resume the talks with the Austrians. Some of the officers were against this and conjured against Klapka, but they were caught and put to jail.\nKlapka sent a demand to the besiegers demanding from the Austrians to give total amnesty for all people from Hungary, who participated in the revolution and in the War of Independence, and to liberate the war prisoners. Probably Klapka knew that these conditions could not be accepted, but he wanted to win time, hoping for a new Hungarian urpaising or a foreign help. He also hoped that with these exaggerated demands he will be able to obtain at least amnesty for the defenders of Komárom. This was rejected, Lieutenant Field Marshal Anton Csorich demanding unconditional surrender, so the Hungarians decided to continue the resistance. \nOn 26 September the main commander of the Austrian froces Julius Jacob von Haynau arrived to Komárom, took over the leadership of the besieging forces and ordered general attack against the fortress, but it was easily repulsed by the Hungarian artillery and a Hussar squadron. This was the last military engagement of the Hungarian War of Independence of 1848-1849. \n\nHaynau understood that taking Komárom will be a very hard and very long task, and it will cause thousands of deaths among his troops, so he decided to seek a compromise with Klapka and the defenders. \n\nFinally on 27 September 1849 the delegation of the defenders agreed with Field Marshal Haynau about the conditions of the capitulation of the fortress. These conditions were as follows:\n- The soldiers could leave without their arms, while the officers could leave retaining theirs;\n- Those officers who prior to the Hungarian War of Independece were in the Austrian army, received passport to leave the country;\n- Those who didn't wanted to leave, they could return home, without being prosecuted;\n- Those Hungarian officers who prior to the war were not in the Austrian army could return home, they were free to work in any profession, start businesses, but they were prohibited to be conscripted in the army again;\n- The former soldiers of the Habsburg armies received total amnesty;\n- Thos who wanted to leave the country, had to ask for passports in 30 days;\n- The officers received payment for 30 days, while the simple soldiers for 10 days in Austrian banknotes;\n- The vouchers used as money by the soldiers and the people of Komárom during the siege, will be redeemed in Austrian banknotes;\n- The crippled, the sick and the wounded people and soldiers which were in the hospitals of Komárom will receive medical attendance; \n- Everybody will retain their personalities and realties. \n\nThe amnesty given by the Austrians regarded only the soldiers. But Klapka knew that the civilian people, intellectuals or politicians, who lived or retreated in Komárom, who participated in the Hungarian revolution and politics can be prosecuted by the Austrians after the surrender of Komárom. So he gave to all of them military certificates. \n\nBetween 2-5 October 1849 Klapka surrendered the fortress to Haynau, with this ending the Hungarian War of Independence.\n\nOn 2 October the Hungarian troops started to evacuate one by one the fortifications and different buildings of the fortress and the town. The soldiers formed lines before the \"Starfort\" (Csillagerőd), while the military orchestra played the \"Klapka March\". Then came Klapka, who rode before their lines, then he stopped on the middle and said goodbye to them. Then the soldiers put their weapons in stacks, and took farewell from each other. At the end all of them received \"Geleitscheins\" (safe conduct papers), which assured for them their total freedom and immunity.\n\nAt the end Klapka declared:\n\nIndeed, in the history of the 1848-1849 European revolutions only Komárom and Venice put their weapons down with such favourable conditions. \nThe capitulation of Komárom was the last event from the Hungarian Revolution and War of Independence, and it was the last place in the European revolutions of 1848-1849, which ended the resistance against the united forces of the monarchies.\n\nSo the capitulation of Komárom by Klapka was the last event of the European 1848-49 Revolutions.\n\nKlapka left the country at once, and lived thenceforward for many years in exile, at first in England and afterwards chiefly in Switzerland. He became a Swiss citizen, he settled in Geneva and started to work in the finances. He went to Istanbul, working at a bank. He continued by every means in his power to work for the independence of Hungary, especially at moments of European war, such as 1854, 1859 and 1866, at which an appeal to arms seemed to him to promise success.\" Using his international reputation as great Hungarian general, won in the press of the European countries became a sort of \"wandering ambassador\" of the Hungarian cause, trying to win supporters to start a new Hungarian freedom war. \n\nHe tried to create an alliance with the states and nations which were neighbours with Hungary, like the Principality of Serbia or Moldavia and Wallachia, and supported the Polish Uprising of 1863–1864 against Russia. \nIn 1859, Alexander John Cuza, the first Ruler of the United Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia, offered general Klapka military support asking for a favourable reconfiguration of other peoples' situation in the Habsburg Empire (including Romanians): \"In May 1859 two agreements were signed between Alexandru Ioan Cuza and general Klapka, commander of the Hungarian revolutionaries, by which A.I. Cuza commits to obtain and provide weapons to Hungarian revolutionaries, helping them against Austria, at the same time setting the principles for reconciliation between the nationalities of Austria.\" During the Crimean War (1853-1856), the Ottoman government wanted to appoint him as a commander of an army, but they renounced upon the protests of Austria.\n\nDuring the Second Italian War of Independence (1859) Lajos Kossuth signed an agreement with Napoleon III the emperor of France, to organize in Italy a Hungarian Legion from the Hungarian soldiers from Italy, which had to break in Hungary, and organize a rebellion there against the Habsburgs. Klapka, who became a member of the \"Hungarian National Directorate\" (Magyar Nemzeti Igazgatóság), which was fulfilling the role of a Hungarian government in exile, was appointed to organize and then lead it. But it wasn't Napoleon's interest to destroy the Habsburg Empire, so, after the Battle of Solferino he concluded a peace treaty with the Habsburgs, without asking the Italians or the Hungarians opinion. As a result of this the Hungarian Legion disbanded, and Klapka protested against this by retireing. He was more and more disappointed with Kossuth's role and activity in leading the fight for the Hungarian cause in Europe, believing that Kossuth's policy is condemned to fail.\n\nWhen the Austro-Prussian War from 1866 broke out, the Hungarian politicians and officers in exile agreed with the Minister President of Prussia Otto von Bismarck to form a Hungarian Legion, which had to fight against Austria, and start a national uprising in Hungary. Once again Klapka was designated to organize a Hungarian corps in Silesia), and as major-general to lead it into Hungary. He gathered 1500 soldiers, but when, at 3 August 1866 he entered in Hungary through the Jablonka Pass in Hungary, the fate of the war was already decided, and the Austrians and the Prussians concluded an armistice, so he lost the Prussian support. Klapka was informed about the armistice when he was preparing to cross the Jablonka pass into Hungary, and the Prussians asked him to retreat, and stop his military actions. Klapka refused this and entered in Hungary, advancing until Turzófalva, but the Slovak population which lived there didn't wanted to join his troops. Then Klapka's 1500 soldiers were met by much superior Austrian troops, which forced him to retreat. Klapka protested against this by retireing, and once again, the Hungarian Legion was disbanded.\n\nAfter the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 Klapka was permitted to return to his native country, but as well as in the case of Artúr Görgei, the emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria didn't allowed him to join the army, because he didn't forgave him his campaign attempt in Hungary from 1866. As a result of this Klapka turned to politics, between 1868-1872 becoming member of the right wing Deák Party, being elected in the Hungarian Parliament as a deputy of Illava, then his hometown Temesvár. He didn't spoke often from the pulpit, instead he edited a political magazine. In 1868 he became the president of the associations of the Hungarian veteran soldiers of 1848-1849.\n\nAfter a while he retired from politics and tried his luck in economy, spending his time in Istanbul and Genoa, founding there businesses. \n\nIn 1864 he married with the daughter of an English businessman, who settled in Brussels. Her name was Inez d'Arboin, they settled in France and had two boys and a girl: György, Ernő and Márta. In this period Klapka spent much of his time in Cognac. \n\nFrom the 1870s, Klapka couldn't withstand to the homesickness, so he returned to Hungary. He was celebrated by the crowd in Budapest and in other towns, he was offered to return in politics, but he refused, continuing to work in economy. \n\nIn 1877 he tried to convince Hungary to open a war against the Russians to help the Ottomans. During the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878) he became a military counselor of the Ottoman army.\n\nIn his last years he lived in the Crown Prince Joseph Hotel (József Főherceg Szálloda) from Budapest. He died in 17 May 1892 in Budapest. His coffin was escorted to the cemetery by a huge crowd singing the Klapka March. The first handfull of earth which was thrown on his coffin, was taken from Komárom, the fortress which he defended so heroically in 1849. He was buried in the Kerepesi Cemetery in Budapest. \nA memorial was erected to his memory at Komárom in 1896 and the city's museum was named after him.\n\nHe wrote the following works:\n\nHere were mentioned only the original editions in the language in which Klapka wrote them. These books were translated very quickly in English, French, German and Hungarian.\n\nBesides of these he wrote many articles in Hungarian and foreign newspapers and magazines, like : \"La Presse\" from Paris, \"Independence\" from Bruxelles, and \"Pesti Napló\", \"Századunk\", \"Honvédmenház Könyve\", \"Pesti Hirlap\", \"Nemzet\", \"Budapesti Szemle\", \"Ország-Világ\", all these Hungarian newspapers and magazines.<br>\n\nAs mentioned before, in 1849, Béni Egressy wrote the \"Klapka March\" to honor Klapka as a great commander and Hungarian patriot.\n\nThe writer Jerome Klapka Jerome, best known for \"Three Men in a Boat\", was named after him by his father who was impressed by György Klapka's reputation as a great general and patriot, when the latter was spending his time in Great Britain.<br>\n\n\n",

A number of lake freighters larger than this size cruise the Great Lakes and cannot pass through to the Atlantic Ocean. The size of the locks limits the size of the ships which can pass and so limits the size of the cargoes they can carry. The record tonnage for one vessel on the Seaway is 28,502 tons of iron ore while the record through the larger locks of the Great Lakes Waterway is 72,351 tons. Most new lake vessels, however, are constructed to the Seawaymax limit to enhance versatility by allowing the possibility of off-Lakes use. SS \"Edmund Fitzgerald\", famous for her wreck in 1975, was the first ship constructed close to Seawaymax size.\n\n\n",

    "text": "Medicare dual eligible\n\nDual-eligible beneficiaries (Medicare dual eligibles or \"duals\") refers to those qualifying for both Medicare and Medicaid benefits. In the United States, approximately 9.2 million people are eligible for \"dual\" status. Dual-eligibles make up 14% of Medicaid enrollment, yet they are responsible for approximately 36% of Medicaid expenditures. Similarly, duals total 20% of Medicare enrollment, and spend 31% of Medicare dollars. Dual-eligibles are often in poorer health and require more care compared with other Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.\n\nMedicare is the primary payer for most services, but Medicaid covers benefits not offered by Medicare. Medicare coverage for dual-eligibles includes hospitalizations, physician services, prescription drugs, skilled nursing facility care, home health visits, and hospice care. Under Medicaid, states are required to cover certain items and services for dual-eligibles, including long-term nursing facility services and home health services. Although states are required to cover certain populations and services, they have the option to expand coverage beyond these mandatory levels (i.e., offer home and community-based services), and accordingly state Medicaid programs vary in scope. Dual-eligibles may be categorized as full-benefit or partial-benefit. Those with full benefits may receive the entire range of Medicaid benefits; those with partial-benefits do not receive Medicaid-covered services, but Medicaid covers their Medicare premiums or cost-sharing, or both. Partial benefit dual-eligible beneficiaries have limited income and assets, but their income and assets are not low enough to qualify them for full Medicaid benefits in their state.\n\nWith the advent of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, these dual eligibles have automatically been enrolled to a random Medicare Part D plan, effective January 1 of 2006. As a result of this auto assignment, participants who were already enrolled in a Medicare Advantage HMO, may have been automatically disenrolled from their medical plan to allow for part D enrollment. Medicaid will still cover drugs for dual-eligible patients that are not covered by Medicare Part D, including certain controlled substances.\n\nDual-eligibles typically receive their Medicare and Medicaid benefits through each program separately. For Medicare benefits, beneficiaries may opt to enroll in Medicare's traditional fee-for-service (FFS) program or in a private Medicare Advantage (MA) plan (Medicare Part C), which is administered by a Managed Care Organization (MCO), under contract with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency in the Department of Health and Human Services that administers the Medicare program and oversees state Medicaid programs. In addition, dual-eligibles may choose a type of MA plan called a dual-eligible special needs plan (D-SNP), which is designed to target the needs of this population. For Medicaid benefits, beneficiaries generally enroll in their state's Medicaid FFS program or a Medicaid managed care plan administered by an MCO under contract with the state.\n\nRecently, Congress and CMS have placed greater emphasis on the coordination and integration of Medicare and Medicaid benefits for dual-eligible beneficiaries. For example, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 required D-SNPs to contract with state Medicaid agencies to provide Medicaid benefits. More recently, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) established a type of D-SNP, referred to as a Fully Integrated Dual Eligible (FIDE) SNP, which—unlike other D-SNPs—is designed to integrate program benefits for dual-eligible beneficiaries through a single managed care organization, although payment is generally provided separately by each program. In 2011, CMS announced a financial alignment demonstration that is intended to further integrate the programs' services. CMS expects that the demonstration will decrease incentives for cost shifting and increase care coordination, resulting in improved care for beneficiaries and savings to Medicare and Medicaid. CMS projects that approximately 61 to 75 percent of savings will come from reductions in costly Medicare-covered services.\n\nHistorically, one of the major challenges for the dually-eligible has been care coordination between Medicare and Medicaid. These two systems of care do not \"talk to each other\" systematically, so one physician that bills primarily through Medicare may not be familiar with benefits that are available through Medicaid. Additionally, since Medicaid benefits vary by state, it is difficult for care providers and consumers to understand the complexity that is inherent within the Medicaid system.\n\nBecause duals tend to be the most vulnerable, and often sickest, adults, their care has historically been expensive, totaling $319.5 billion in 2011. One proposed reason for this significant cost would be that many Medicaid programs, prior to the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) used a fee-for-service model. Fee-for-service models are typically more costly because they allow providers to charge for the quantity of care they provide, rather than the quality.\n\nIn order to resolve these pain points, the ACA includes provisions that specifically address the coverage and care of duals. On a federal level, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has established two new offices: The Federal Coordinated Health Care Office (FCHCO aka the \"duals office\") as well as the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) in order to both strategize and monitor the type and quality of care afforded to duals. These offices focus on both monetary expenses as well as care innovation and quality for dual eligible beneficiaries.\n\nA study by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the integration of Medicare and Medicaid benefits generally improves the care provided to dual-eligibles but does not lead to Medicare savings or a reduction in costly Medicare services (i.e., emergency room visits, hospital admissions, and 30-day risk-adjusted all-cause readmissions). Medicare Advantage health plans that fully integrated Medicare and Medicaid benefits for dual-eligibles (i.e., FIDE-SNPs) generally had better quality of care scores (particularly for intermediate outcome measures) relative to plans with less integration of benefits. However, only FIDE-SNPs that operated in states with long-standing integration programs performed well on quality of care scores. While the care provided generally improved for dual-eligibles enrolled in FIDE-SNPs, very few of these plans reported lower estimated Medicare costs relative to what Medicare's fee-for-service program would have spent for beneficiaries with the same demographic and health characteristics. Furthermore, the FIDE-SNPs that reported potential Medicare savings generally did not demonstrate lower costs than other D-SNPs in the same geographic areas. These results were consistent for dual-eligibles both under the age of 65 and those age 65 and over. While operating specialized plans and integrating benefits could lead to improved care, GAO's results suggest that these conditions have not demonstrated a reduction in dual-eligible beneficiaries' Medicare spending compared with Medicare spending in settings without integrated benefits. Because the GAO study also found that the average number of costly Medicare services increases as the number of chronic and mental health conditions increase, it is possible that savings were not demonstrated because the population being served by FIDE-SNPs is too large to be cost-effective and major complications were averted for relatively few beneficiaries.\n\nA study looking at physician's views of Medicare Part D, and in particular how it pertains to dual-eligibles, found that many physicians expressed concern regarding access to prescription drugs, especially for dual-eligibles. Almost half of physicians responded that the access to prescription drugs for dual-eligibles was worse under Part D than relative to the previous Medicaid, and more than half (63%) reported higher administration burden. Many physicians stated that dual-eligibles had less access under Part D than in three Medicaid restrictive states. This suggests that the transparency of Part D formulary coverage needs to be improved to improve access to these resources for physicians.\n\nA further study by the same group of researchers found that despite the above physicians' views on access to healthcare among dual-eligibles, there were no statistically significant changes in pharmaceutical utilization or out-of-pocket expenditures in the 18 months after Medicare Part D implementation. When comparing a group of dual-eligibles (the experimental group) with a control group of near-elderly Medicaid-covered patients, both groups showed a decline in costs rights after the implementation of Part D, which then leveled off. The expenditures for both groups tracked each other.\n\n",

In this book, Lewis examines the history of various words used in the English language which have changed their meanings often quite widely throughout the centuries. The meanings in the predecessor languages are also part of the discussion. \n\nLewis's motivation for writing the book was in explaining to students of the work of previous centuries that the definition of a word that they already think they know (his \"dangerous sense\", which he abbreviates \"D.S.\") may yield a total misunderstanding of what the author meant to say. Those who have a large vocabulary are actually more likely to pick a wrong meaning because they can rationalize its enjambment. Some of the earlier meanings are only partially recalled in stock phrases, such as \"world without end,\" which employs the earlier use of the word \"world\" to mean 'age'. \n\nThe words studied are \"nature,\" in all its phrases, especially \"human nature\"; \"sad,\" which originally meant \"heavy\"; \"wit\"; \"free\", with all its differences from slavery and villainy; \"sense\", with its two meanings of perception and judgement; \"simple\"; \"conscience\" and \"conscious\"; \"world\"; and \"life\"; with also the phrase \"I dare say!\" examined.

The Red Ribbon Foundation and Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) are examples of organizations that utilize the red ribbon symbol. MADD is an organization founded in 1980 whose mission is to stop drunk driving, support the victims of this violent crime and prevent underage drinking. Red Ribbon International is an organization founded in 1993 whose main purpose is the education about prevention of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus or HIV, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Related Complex, ARC and AIDS.\n\nIn 1986, MADD started the \"Tie One On For Safety\" campaign. It is MADD’s longest running and most visible public awareness project. During the holiday season, drivers are encouraged to tie MADD red ribbons to visible locations on their vehicles, or place window decals on their vehicles’ windows. The red ribbons represent the drivers’ commitment to drive safe, sober and buckled up. It also encourages others to designate a sober driver before drinking.\n\nThe Red Ribbon was used as an awareness symbol made by after DEA Agent Enrique Camarena was kidnapped, tortured, and murdered while working undercover in Guadalajara, Mexico. Citizens in his home town of Calexico, California donned the ribbons to emphasize the need for increased prevention efforts. In 1988, Red Ribbon Week, sponsored by National Family Partnership, became a national campaign. It is celebrated from October 23 through October 31.\n\nThe Red Ribbon Project was created by the New York-based Visual AIDS Artists Caucus in 1991.\n\nThe artists who formed the Visual AIDS Artists Caucus wished to create a visual symbol to demonstrate compassion for people living with AIDS and their caregivers. Inspired by the yellow ribbons honoring American soldiers serving in the Gulf war, the color red was chosen for its, \"connection to blood and the idea of passion—not only anger, but love, like a valentine.\" First worn publicly by Jeremy Irons at the 1991 Tony Awards, the ribbon soon became renowned as an international symbol of AIDS awareness.\n\nAt the \"Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert\" held at Wembley Stadium, London on Easter Sunday 1992, more than 100,000 red ribbons were distributed among the audience by Red Ribbon International, with performers such as George Michael wearing one. The Red Ribbon continues to be a powerful force in the fight to increase public awareness of HIV/AIDS and in the lobbying efforts to increase funding for AIDS services and research.\n\nTo symbolize the United States' commitment to combat the world AIDS epidemic through its landmark PEPFAR program, Steven M. Levine, a communications aid in President George W. Bush's administration, proposed that the administration display a AIDS ribbon on the White House's iconic North Portico on World AIDS Day 2007. The display, now an annual tradition across three administrations, quickly garnered attention, as it was the first banner, sign or symbol to prominently hang from the White House since Abraham Lincoln lived in the building.\n\nAt fairs and competitions in Canada, a red ribbon is awarded to the winning competitor (first place). It is used for second place in the United States for horticultural fairs.\nIn the U.S. in some judging competitions, particularly in 4-H and FFA livestock and horticultural competitions, red ribbons may be given to a project that meets some of the judging criteria but falls short in other areas, while superior projects and exhibits are awarded blue ribbons (which are second-place ribbons in Canada).\n\n\n",

After filling clerical posts in Leipzig (1845–1856), he became a preacher at the Leopoldstädter Tempel in Vienna in 1856.\n\nHe was associated with the promoters of the \"New Learning\" within Judaism, and wrote on the history of the Kabbalah in the tradition of Western scholarship. Jellinek is also known for his work in German on Abraham ben Samuel Abulafia, one of the earliest students of Kabbalah who was born in Spain in 1240. Jellinek's bibliographies (each bearing the Hebrew title \"Qontres\") were useful compilations, but his most important work lay in three other directions:\nmidrashic, psychological and homiletic.\n\nJellinek published in the six parts of his \"Beth ha-Midrasch\" (1853–1878) a large number of smaller Midrashim, ancient and medieval homilies and folklore records, which have been of much service in the revival of interest in Jewish apocalyptic literature. A translation of these collections of Jellinek into German was undertaken by August Wuensche, under the general title \"Aus Israels Lehrhallen\".\n\nBefore the study of ethnic psychology had become a science, Jellinek devoted attention to the subject. There is much keen analysis and original investigation in his two essays \"Der jüdische Stamm\" (1869) and \"Der jüdische Stamm in nicht-jüdischen Sprichwörtern\" (1881–1882). Jellinek compared the Jewish temperament to that of women in its quickness of perception, versatility and sensibility.\n\nJellinek was probably the greatest synagogue orator of the 19th century. He published some 200 sermons, in most of which are displayed unobtrusive learning, fresh application of old sayings, and a high conception of Judaism and its claims. According to Abrahams, Jellinek was a powerful apologist and an accomplished homilist, at once profound and ingenious.\n\nHis wife was Rosalie Bettelheim (born 1832 in Budapest, died 1892 in Baden bei Wien). Their family included:\nThe eldest son, Georg Jellinek (1851–1911), professor of international law at Heidelberg University.\nAnother son, Max Hermann Jellinek (1868–1938), was made assistant professor of German philology at Vienna University in 1892, became an associate professor in 1900 and was a full professor from 1906 until 1934, and from 1919 also a member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.\nA third son, Emil Jellinek (1853–1918), was an automobile entrepreneur, whose daughter Mercedes inspired the brand name of Mercedes Benz. His daughter Paula Jellinek married a lawyer, Dr. Jur. Heinrich Wechsberg and was the aunt of psychiatrist Erwin Wexberg. \nA brother of Adolf, Hermann Jellinek (born 1823), was executed at the age of 26 on account of his association with the Hungarian national movement of 1848. One of Hermann Jellinek's best-known works was \"Uriel Acosta\".\nAnother brother, Moritz Jellinek (1823–1883), was an accomplished economist, and contributed to the Academy of Sciences essays on the price of cereals and on the statistical organization of the country. He founded the Budapest tramway company (1864) and was also president of the corn exchange.\n\n\n",

This \"chicha press,\" comprising about 15 sensationalist newspapers, followed instructions of the former head of the National Intelligence Service, Vladimiro Montesinos. The idea, carried out with success, was to maintain popular approval of Fujimori's government by destroying political opposition candidates and politicians. Once Fujimori resigned, many of the newspapers closed, but some, such as \"La Razón\" and \"El Chino\" survived. \"La Razón\"', still owned by Moises Wolfenson, opposes President Alejandro Toledo's government, and it is said that is now the main platform and vehicle for Fujimori's messages from Japan. \"La Razón\" contends that the Wolfensons were convicted without sufficient proof and that their sentence is in effect political revenge.\n\nAccording to a report on Human Rights Practices, by the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, released March 31, 2003, In May 2002, Toledo's government authorities placed the Wolfenson brothers, publishers of pro-Fujimori tabloid El Chino and of opposition daily La Razón, under house arrest on corruption charges. On June 22 of the same year, a radio station broadcast a tape in which Salomon Lerner Ghitis, the chairman of the government-owned Financial Corporation for Development and a government insider, threatened both Alex and Moises with judicial proceedings and jail time should they continue to criticize the Government. On August 1, an anticorruption judge found the daily newspapers \"El Men\", \"El Tio\" and Editora Sport, S.A., the company that published opposition dailies La Razón and El Chino, guilty of corporate embezzlement for the dealings their publishers Jose Olaya and Moises Wolfenson had with Vladimiro Montesinos. In September of the same year a court ratified the house arrest for the Wolfenson brothers.\n\nIn July 2005, congress issued a controversial law # 28658, which stated that days spent under house arrest could count as days in jail, so Moises and his brother Alex were freed. However, on July 25, 2005, Mr. Wolfenson presented himself to the Supreme Court first penal transitory court, because the Constitutional Tribunal declared unconstitutional and abolished law 28658 after only one week of having been issued law by congress, so the Supreme court ordered the Wolfenson brothers to come again to be jailed. Before entering jail, Moises declared that he considers himself persecuted politically by the current government.\n",

Valduggia is now in the Province of Vercelli in Piedmont. He is said to have first learned the art of painting at Vercelli from Gerolamo Giovenone. He subsequently studied in Milan, in the school of the Cathedral artisan Giovanni Stefano Scotti, and perhaps alongside Bernardino Luini. HCirca 1504 he proceeded to Florence. It was once thought that he later moved to Rome. He died in Milan.\n\nGaudenzio was not related to Defendente Ferrari (c.1490–1535) a painter from Chivasso, nor to Eusebio Ferrari (1508–33) the painter from Vercelli.\n\nHis initial pictorial style may be considered as derived mainly from the old Milanese school, which had imbibed the classic influence of Leonardo and pupils such as Bramantino. However, the provincial impetus was also strong, as is demonstrated in his emotive work at the Sacro Monte of Varallo.\n\nBy 1513, Gaudenzio had depicted the \"Life of Christ\" in a fresco at Santa Maria delle Grazie in Varallo Sesia. He returned to work in the chapels of the Sacro Monte di Varallo by 1524. The chapels are dispersed over a hilltop sanctuary, connected by a winding path, and containing a combination of \"diorama and wax museum\" with life-size terracotta figures. He executed his most memorable work, a fresco of the Crucifixion (pictured right), with a multitude of figures, no less than twenty-six of them being modelled in actual relief, and colored; on the vaulted ceiling are lamenting angels. The figures include goitrous bestial assailants.\n\nThere are other works which show flashes of innovation such as the crowded chorus decorating duomo of Santa Maria dei Miracoli in Saronno or his fresco of \"St Anne\". This painting shows the overlap of Milanese realism and Venetian colorism.\n\nHe was a very prolific painter, distinguished by strong animation. In general character, his work suggests more the 15th than the 16th century. His subjects were always religious. Andrea Solario, Giovanni Battista Cerva, Gian Paolo Lomazzo, and Fermo Stella were his principle students.\n\n\n\n",

It is intended to replace the s. Construction began in 2007 and the first unit will be commissioned in 2020.\n\nIn October 1998, the \"Delegation Générale pour l'Armement\", the French government's defense procurement agency, established an integrated project team consisting of the Naval Staff, DCN (now known as Naval Group), Technicatome and the \"Commissariat a l'Énergie Atomique\", a regulatory body that oversees nuclear power plants, to oversee the design of a new attack submarine class. DCN was to be the boat's designer and builder while Technicatome (since acquired by Areva) was to be responsible for the nuclear power plant. The two companies were to act jointly as a single prime contractor to share the industrial risks, manage the schedules, and be responsible for the design's performance and costs, which at the time was estimated to be US$4.9 billion.\n\nOn 22 December 2006, the French government placed a €7.9 billion order for six Barracuda submarines with Naval Group and their nuclear power plants with Areva-Technicatome. According to the DGA “Competition at the subcontractor level will be open to foreign companies for the first time.” According to the contract, the first boat was to commence sea trials in early 2016, with delivery occurring in late 2016/early 2017. This was to be followed by entry into service in late 2017.\n\nNaval Group also designed a conventionally powered derivative, dubbed the SMX-Ocean, featuring fuel cells and vertical launchers. Another conventionally powered design, the Shortfin Barracuda, was selected as a future replacement for the vessels with the Royal Australian Navy.\n\nIn 2016, Naval Group also began to position itself and its Shortfin Barracuda design to the Royal Canadian Navy's Future Canadian Submarines project. The project is planned to replace the s by 2030.\n\nNaval Group is also offering a version of the \"Shortfin\" diesel-electric variant as replacement for the current submarines of the Royal Netherlands Navy competing against the A26 design by Saab and Damen\n\nBarracudas will use technology from the , including pump-jet propulsion. This class reportedly produces approximately 1/1000 of the detectable noise of the \"Redoutable\"-class boats (submarines), and they are ten times more sensitive in detecting other submarines. They will be fitted with torpedo-tube-launched cruise missiles MDCN SCALP Naval for long-range (well above ) strikes against strategic land targets. Their missions will include anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare, land attack, intelligence gathering, crisis management and special operations.\n\nThe Barracuda class nuclear reactor incorporates several improvements over that of the preceding \"Rubis\". Notably, it extends the time between refueling and complex overhauls (RCOHs) from 7 to 10 years, enabling higher at-sea availability.\n\nIn support of special operations missions, Barracudas may also accommodate up to 12 commandos, while carrying their equipment in a mobile pod attached aft of the sail.\n\nDesigned by Naval Group and TechnicAtome, this submarine will have the following main general features:\n\nNaval Group submitted a conventionally powered diesel-electric variation to the design – named the Shortfin Barracuda Block 1A – to the competitive evaluation process (CEP) phase of Australia's \"Collins\"-class submarine replacement. \"While exact details remain confidential, DCNS can confirm the Shortfin Barracuda is over 90 metres in length and displaces more than 4,000 tons when dived,\" said Sean Costello, CEO of Naval Group Australia. Naval Group was chosen by the Australian Government on 26 April 2016 to build twelve of the Shortfin Barracuda Block 1A variant at a projected AU$50 billion (US$). Much of the works will be undertaken at ASC Pty Ltd in Adelaide, South Australia. Construction is expected to begin in 2020 or 2021.\n\nThe class will be known as the with the first vessel named HMAS \"Attack\".\n\n\n",

    "text": "Southern Thai language\n\nSouthern Thai (Southern Thai/Thai: ), also known as Pak Thai (Southern Thai: ) or Dambro ( ), is a Southwestern Tai language spoken in the fourteen provinces of southern Thailand as well as by small communities in the northernmost Malaysian states. It is spoken by roughly five million people, and as a second language by the 1.5 million speakers of Pattani and other ethnic groups such as the local Thai Chinese communities, Negritos, and other tribal groups. Most speakers are also fluent or understand the Central Thai dialects.\n\nAlthough Central Thai is most widely spoken, Thailand is home to other related Tai languages. Although linguists usually classify these idioms as related, but distinct languages, native speakers often identify them as regional variants or dialects of the \"same\" Thai language, or as \"different kinds of Thai\".\n\nPhonyarit (2018) recognizes the following nine main dialects of Southern Thai, based on tone split and merger patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Thailand, speakers of Southern Thai can be found in a contiguous region beginning as far north as southern part of Prachuap Khiri Khan Province and extending southward to the border with Malaysia. Smaller numbers of speakers reside in the Malaysian border states, especially Kedah, Kelantan, Penang, Perlis, and Perak. In these areas, it is the primary language of ethnic Thais as well as of the ethnically Malay people on both sides of the Thai-Malaysian border in Satun and Songkhla provinces. Although numerous regional variations exist and there is no one standard, the language is most distinct near the Malaysian border. All varieties, however, remain mutually intelligible. For economic reasons, many speakers of Southern Thai have migrated to Bangkok and other Thai cities. Some have also emigrated to Malaysia, which offers not only economic opportunity but also a culture which shares the Islamic faith practiced by some speakers of Southern Thai.\n\nMalay kingdoms ruled much of the Malay Peninsula, such as the Pattani Kingdom and Tambralinga, but most of the area, at one time or another, was under the rule of Srivijaya. The population of the Malay peninsula was heavily influenced by the culture of India transmitted through missionaries or indirectly through traders. Numerous Buddhist and Hindu shrines attest to the diffusion of Indian culture. The power vacuum left by the collapse of Srivijaya was filled by the growth of the kingdom of Nakhon Si Thammarat, which subsequently became a vassal of the Sukhothai Kingdom. The area has been a frontier between the northern Tai peoples and the southern ethnic Malays as well as between Buddhism and Islam.\n\n\nThe majority of speakers using Southern Thai varieties display five phonemic tones (tonemes) in citation monosyllables, although effects of sandhi can result in a substantially higher number of tonal allophones. This is true for dialects north of approximately 10° N and south of 7° N latitude, as well as urban sociolects throughout Southern Thailand. In between, there are dialects with six- and seven-tone systems. The dialect of Nakhon Si Thammarat Province (approximately centered on 8° N latitude) for example, has seven phonemic tones.\n\nSouthern thai consonant inventory is similar to that of Central thai; but lack sound.\n\nIn Southrn thai, each syllable in a word is considered separate from the others, so combinations of consonants from adjacent syllables are never recognised as a cluster. Southern thai has phonotactical constraints that define permissible syllable structure, consonant clusters, and vowel sequences. Original Thai vocabulary introduces only 11 combined consonantal patterns:\n\nAll plosive sounds are unreleased. Hence, final , , and sounds are pronounced as , , and respectively.\n\nThe vowels of the Southern thai are similar to those of Central Thai. They, from front to back and close to open, are given in the following table. The top entry in every cell is the symbol from the International Phonetic Alphabet, the second entry gives the spelling in the Thai alphabet, where a dash (–) indicates the position of the initial consonant after which the vowel is pronounced. A second dash indicates that a final consonant must follow.\n\nThe vowels each exist in long-short pairs: these are distinct phonemes forming unrelated words in Isan, but usually transliterated the same: เขา (\"khao\") means \"he/she\", while ขาว (\"khao\") means \"white\".\n\nThe long-short pairs are as follows:\n\nThe basic vowels can be combined into diphthongs. For purposes of determining tone, those marked with an asterisk are sometimes classified as long:\n\nAdditionally, there are three triphthongs. For purposes of determining tone, those marked with an asterisk are sometimes classified as long:\n\nAlthough of the major regional languages of Thailand, Southern Thai is most similar in lexicon and grammar to Central Thai, the varieties are sufficiently different that mutual intelligibility between the two can be problematic. Southern Thai presents a diglossic situation wherein registers range from the most formal (Standard Central Thai spoken with Southern Thai tones and accent) to the common vernacular (usually a contracted form of Thai expressions and with some amount of loan words from Malay). The Thai language was introduced with Siamese incursions into the Malay Peninsula possibly starting as early as the Sukhothai Kingdom. During this and successive kingdoms, the area in which Southern Thai is spoken was a frontier zone between Thai polities and the Malay Sultanates. Malay vocabulary has been absorbed into the lexicon, as a considerable number of Malay speakers lived in or near Patani polity and interacted with the Thai speakers through trade; and the Malay language was formerly considered to be a lingua franca of the southern part of the Malay peninsula.\n\nSouthern Thai is mainly a spoken language, although the Thai alphabet is often used in the informal situations when it is written.\n\nThe words used that are etymologically Thai are often spoken in a reduced and rapid manner, making comprehension by speakers of other varieties difficult. Also, as Southern Thai uses up to seven tones in certain provinces, the tonal distribution is different from other regional varieties of Thai. Additionally, Southern Thai speakers almost always preserve ร as /r/ in contrast to Northern Thai, the Lao-based Isan language, and informal registers of Central Thai where it is generally realized as /l/.\n\n",

    "text": "Frank Johnston (artist)\n\nFrancis Hans Johnston (June 19, 1888July 19, 1949) was a Canadian artist associated with the Group of Seven.\n\nFrank Johnston (also known as Franz) was born on June 19, 1888 in Toronto. Like many other Group members, he joined Grip Engraving Co. as a commercial artist. He studied in Germany from 1904 to 1907. Although his official association with the Group of Seven was brief, his friendship with the artists dated back over a much longer period. In 1910, he left for the United States where he studied art in Philadelphia and worked in commercial design in New York. Although an original member of the Group, Johnston's association was brief. He did take part in the Group's first exhibition of 1920, but by 1921 he had left Toronto to become Principal at the Winnipeg School of Art. In the earlier years of their friendship, Johnston had joined MacDonald and Harris on their journeys to Algoma. His paintings from those years express a strong decorative interpretation of the landscape. In later years, the artist's style became more realistic and revealed a strong fascination with the qualities of light. His landscape paintings became very full of images reflected on water. In 1927, Johnston changed his name to the more exotic title of `Franz' Johnston. He painted over 250 paintings in his entire career.\nJohnston had much in common with these artists. Like them, in the years before World War I he used his spare time to pursue landscape painting, through sketching trips around Toronto and farther north to Bon Echo near Algonquin Park and to Hearst, north of Lake Superior—a source of inspiration for him. An eager participant in Group activities, Johnston went on all the Algoma trips except the last. Johnston did not use the techniques of Harris and MacDonald but, employing tempera rather than oil paint, he searched out the pattern and texture of his subject.\nJohnston exhibited with The Group of Seven only once, in their first show at the Art Gallery of Toronto (now the Art Gallery of Ontario) in May 1920. Johnston's rate of production was such that in the 1919 Algoma show he contributed sixty works - more than any other artist. A few months later, he extended his independence even more, having a large one-man show of 200 paintings at the T. Eaton Company Galleries. In the fall of 1921, Johnston left Toronto to accept the position as principal of the Winnipeg School of Art. There he held the largest show ever seen in that city. He had been slowly moving away from the Group movement, and now the break was complete. In 1924, he announced his official resignation, claiming that he had no disagreement with the group, only that he wanted to go his own way with regards to exhibitions.\n\nWhen Johnston left The Group, he turned more to working for department store art galleries, concerning himself with decorative effects, which he constantly sought out.\n\nJohnston's style became increasingly realistic throughout his life, evincing a particular fascination for the qualities of light reflected from snow. This theme recurred in later works, in large narrative paintings of the 1930s and 1940s as well as more intimate examinations of a river valley, the bright blue of the water bending between snow-laden banks. His subjects range from the pastoral countryside of the Wyebridge area, northern Quebec, and the Northwest Territories. He had begun in the 1920s to hold regular solo exhibitions and his paintings found a great following among the public. Unlike many Canadian artists, Johnston was able to achieve considerable financial success in his own lifetime.\n\nHe taught at the Ontario College of Art during the 1920s. In 1927, he changed his name to Franz Johnston.\n\nHe was made a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.\n\nHe died in Toronto in 1949 and buried with his fellow artists at McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario.\n\n",

    "text": "Fersen\n\nFersen is a German-language surname derived from the Scottish surname MacPherson. The most well-known groups are the descendants of Clan MacPherson members who migrated in association with military conflict participation in the 16th through 18th centuries. In keeping with the Scottish military identity and the Stuart-era professional soldier class, some left to join foreign militaries and were given knighthoods. The most well-known holders of the surname settled in the Baltic Sea area, including modern day Sweden and the governorate of Livonia (modern day Latvia and Estonia) which were once part of the Russian Empire. \n\nThe earliest records of the Fersen family of the Baltic area in the late 17th century suggest possible links to earlier participation in the Northern Wars; service in Northern Europe was commonplace and Scots had served in great numbers in the series of Northern Wars, whose onset was marked by an invasion of Livonia by Ivan the Terrible in 1558. More secure is their participation in the Thirty Years' War (1619-1648). The official alliances of the Stuart regime, the independent diplomacy of the Scottish Parliament, and the actions of numerous well placed individuals at various European courts combined to make Scotland one of the prime providers of military manpower in Europe, with some 50,000 Scots fighting between 161-1640. After the 1629 peace of Lübeck, many left to join substantial numbers of their compatriots in the Swedish army. During the 1620s the number of Scots serving in the Swedish army is estimated at around 20,000.\n\nThe Swedish branch of the Fersen family originally derived from the line in Livonia. After moving to Sweden, some of its members were awarded Countships for gallant military acts. This line is best known through its line of distinguished military service and for Axel von Fersen the Younger's possible love affair with Marie Antionette, suggested in court accounts and a recently uncovered series of \"torrid\" love letters.\n\nNotable people with the surname include:\n\n",

In 1797 under Captain Alexander Hood she was prominent in the Spithead mutiny. In 1798 at the Battle of the Raz de Sein she fought a famous single-ship duel with the French seventy-four \"Hercule\", in the dusk near the Pointe du Raz on the coast of Brittany. \"Hercule\" attempted to escape through the Passage du Raz but the tide was running in the wrong direction and she was forced to anchor, giving Captain Hood the chance to attack at close quarters. The two ships were of equal strength, but \"Hercule\" was newly commissioned; after more than an hour and a half of bloody fighting at close quarters she struck her flag, having lost over three hundred men. On \"Mars\" 31 men were killed and 60 wounded. Among the dead was Captain Hood.\n\"Mars\" fought at Trafalgar where she was heavily damaged as she took fire from five different French and Spanish seventy-fours. Among the 29 killed and 69 wounded in the action was her captain, George Duff.\n\nIn 1806, on service in the Channel fleet she took part in an action off Chasseron which led to the capture of four French ships.

He is generally recognized to be one of the more outstanding writers in Norwegian literature. He once lacked only one vote to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature, and was nominated twenty-four times, in fourteen years.\n\nDuun was born in the traditional district Ytre Namdal, on Jøa an island in the Namsen Fjord in Fosnes municipality, Nord-Trøndelag county, Norway. His parents were Johannes Antonius Duun and Ellen (Fossum) Duun. Olav Duun was born Ole Johannesen Raaby. Duun was the oldest in a family of eight siblings. During his years as a boy his family lived at several farms on the island, the last one being Duun. He adopted the last name Duun when he left the island to start his training as a teacher.\n\nHe attended the state school at Trøndelag. In 1901, Duun took a position as a school teacher at Levanger in Nord-Trøndelag county, Norway.\n\nHe completed the graduate teacher examination in 1904. In 1908, he was hired by the Ramberg school at Botne in Vestfold, where he combined teaching profession with writing poetry. He worked as a teacher in Holmestrand until 1927. At the age of fifty, he retired in order to devote his time to writing.\n\nDuun was known as one of the outstanding writers of 20th-century Norwegian fiction. He stands as a remarkable synthesis of the Norwegian folk spirit and the European cultural form. Duun wrote in Landsmål, an amalgam of peasant dialects that developed into Nynorsk, one of the official languages of Norway. In the period 1907-38 he published 25 novels, four short story collections (\"sagas\" was his own genre term) and two children's books. Many of his books incorporate the dialects of his subjects: peasants, fishermen and farmers. His novels analyze the psychological and spiritual characteristics of rural, peasant life. Contact with family traditions is a strength for the heroes in his historical novels, and awareness of those who have lived before, and the strength of their actions can help modern people through crises.\n\nThe most notable works are his six volume, \"The People of Juvik\", which deals with four generations of a family of peasant landowners. This work was translated into English and published as: \"The Trough of the Waves\" (1930), \"The Blind Man\" (1931), \"The Big Wedding\" (1932), \"Odin in Fairyland\" (1932), \"Odin Grows Up\" (1934) and \"Storm\" (1935).\n\nOlav and Emma Duun's House (\"Olav og Emma Duuns Hus\") is the former residence of Olav Duun and his wife Emma, at Ramberg in Holmestrand. There is a library containing manuscripts, letters, and other things related to the writing career of Olav Duun. The first floor is at the disposal of recipients of the Duun Scholarship. In the garden, a memorial park has been constructed containing commemorative rocks with lyrical quotes from Olav Duun’s poems. The address is 20 Olav Duun Street.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Sophie Dawes, Baronne de Feuchères\n\nSophie Dawes (c. 1795 – 1840), \"Baronne\" (Baroness) \"de Feuchères\" by marriage, was an English \"adventuress\" best known as a mistress of Louis Henry II, Prince of Condé.\n\nShe was born at St Helens, Isle of Wight, the daughter of an alcoholic fisherman named Richard Daw (or Dawes). She grew up in the workhouse at Newport and after a short period of employment with a local farmer worked as a chambermaid in Portsmouth, then went to London where she worked as a servant in a high-class brothel on Piccadilly. There, she eventually met the exiled duc de Bourbon, afterwards Prince of Condé, in 1811 and became his mistress.\n\nShe was ambitious, and Condé had her educated well not only in modern languages but, as her still extant exercise books show, in Greek and Latin. He took her to Paris and, to prevent scandal and to qualify her to be received at court, had her married in 1818 to Adrien Victor de Feuchères, a major in the Royal Guard. The prince provided her dowry and made her husband his aide-de-camp and a baron. The baroness, pretty and clever, became a person of consequence at the court of Louis XVIII.\n\nHowever, De Feuchères finally discovered the relations between his wife and Condé, whom he had been assured was her father, and left her, obtaining a legal separation in 1827. On hearing of the scandal, the king banished her from his court, declaring her \"naught more than a commoner street-wench yet tragically bereft of any skills of the trade.\" Thanks to her influence, however, Condé was induced in 1829 to sign a will bequeathing about ten million francs to her, and the rest of his estate—more than sixty-six millions—to the duc d'Aumale, fourth son of Louis Philippe.\n\nAgain she was in high favour. Charles X received her at court, Talleyrand visited her, her niece married a marquis Hugues de Chabannes La Palice and her nephew was made a baron. Condé, wearied by his mistress's importunities, and depressed after the July Revolution and the subsequent exile of the King, made up his mind to leave France secretly. When on 27 August 1830 he was found hanging dead from his window, the baroness was suspected and an inquiry was held. But the evidence of death being the result of any crime appearing insufficient, she was not prosecuted. There were rumours that the new King of the French, Louis-Philippe, had collaborated with Sophie in the crime. Later, rumours circulated amongst the nobility that Condé had died pleasuring himself, engaged in what would later be known as autoerotic asphyxiation.\n\nHated as she was by the French, the baroness returned to London, where she died in December 1840. Her grave can still be seen in Kensal Green Cemetery.\n\n",

    "text": "Gizmondo\n\nThe Gizmondo is a handheld gaming console developed by Tiger Telematics. It was released in the UK, Sweden and the U.S. starting in March 2005. Its first-party games were developed in studios in Helsingborg, Sweden, and Manchester, England. Gizmondo Europe, Ltd. was based in London, England, and was a subsidiary of Florida-based Tiger Telematics, whose chairman Carl Freer led Gizmondo's development.\n\nBefore its launch the Gizmondo had high expectations by some journalists due to its extensive feature set, and it was aimed to compete against Nintendo and Sony; however, it ended up as a major sales failure. The company extravagantly spent millions on promotions such as a celebrity party at London's Park Lane Hotel, and taking part at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, despite never making a profit. Its American debut was delayed several times, and a widescreen version was announced shortly before its release - resulting in low sales. With fewer than 25,000 units sold, the Gizmondo was named by GamePro as the worst selling handheld console in history.\n\nThe Gizmondo was further overshadowed when Swedish press revealed criminal pasts of several executives, causing their resignations including Tiger Telematics CEO Carl Freer. Director of Gizmondo Europe Stefan Eriksson was involved in a Swedish criminal organisation, the \"Uppsalamaffian\" (the Uppsala mafia). By February 2006, the company was forced into bankruptcy after amassing US$300 million debt, and the Gizmondo stopped production. Weeks thereafter Eriksson crashed a rare Ferrari Enzo driving at 260km/h in California, and was later jailed and subsequently deported for driving under the influence in connection with the crash and other criminal offenses.\n\nThe Gizmondo device was originally called Gametrac. Tiger Telematics first published on their website in October 2003 about the device being developed. This came in response to Nokia's N-Gage. During December that year, Gizmondo made its debut as a concept product at the Las Vegas CES in January 2004, and later appeared at the German CeBIT show in March 2004. The company and the console were renamed \"Gizmondo\" around April 2004.\n\nBritish Formula One driver Jenson Button appeared on magazine adverts for the Gizmondo, and also had his own licensed video game for the device, \"Chicane\", though it never released due to a dispute with Tiger Telematics and the developer of the game. In London's Regent Street, Tiger Telematics threw a party with several celebrities invited to promote the device. Busta Rhymes, Jodie Kidd and Pharrell Williams were among the celebrities invited, of whom some performed. There were also two television adverts that aired after release. Also, in an attempt to promote the console, Gizmondo's executive Stefan Eriksson took part in the 24 Hours of Le Mans race of 2005 in a Gizmondo-sponsored Ferrari 360 Modena GTC.\n\nThe Gizmondo's problems were compounded by the involvement of Eriksson in Swedish organized crime, and later for crashing a Ferrari Enzo in Malibu, California, which was apparently owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland. He pleaded guilty to numerous criminal charges which led him to 2 years in jail.\n\nIn 2007, GameTrailers named it \"the worst console of all time.\"\n\nTiger Telematics announced a new Gizmondo model for release in Q2 2006. It was intended to have a larger, 4\" widescreen screen and upgrades like Wi-Fi, TV-out support, an improved 480 × 272 pixel resolution, a 2-megapixel camera, and a 500 MHz processor. It also included tri-band GSM technology, effectively making it a mobile phone too. It also featured new icons on the buttons. The widescreen Gizmondo was announced just a few weeks before the U.S. launch of the Gizmondo, possibly prompting some potential customers to not buy the Gizmondo, and instead wait for the improved model, in an example of the Osborne effect. Tiger Telematics promised to show the device at CES 2006 in January; however, it never appeared there. Shortly thereafter Tiger went bankrupt, and thus the new Gizmondo was never released.\n\nGizmondo was released in the United Kingdom on 19 March 2005, priced at £229. The Gizmondo was available from the Gizmondo flagship store on London's Regent Street, via Gizmondo's online shop, and other high-street and online retailers such as Argos, Dixons, Currys, John Lewis, although it was never clear how many units were actually introduced into those retail channels.\n\nThe SMS service of the Gizmondo enabled people to send messages by pre-pay Vodafone accounts bundled in with the device.\n\nThe Gizmondo sold 1000 units within an hour of launch. In April, a month after the initial release, a variant of the console with GPS-assisted \"Smart Adds\" advertising enabled was released with an RRP of £129.\n\nGizmondo was launched in Sweden in the late Summer of 2005, with both \"Smart Adds\" and normal units available. Rather than opening flagship stores, the manufacturer relied on established retailers such as Webhallen. Fewer than 100 units were sold in Sweden. \"Smart Adds\" were never enabled for the Swedish market, even though the technology \"was there\".\n\nIn the United States, the Gizmondo launched on October 22, 2005. Retail price was $400 for a unit without \"Smart Ads\", or $229 for a \"Smart Ads\" enabled device. It was available only at kiosks located in shopping malls throughout the U.S. (operated by National Kiosk, LLC, located in the western corner of North Carolina). Only 8 of the planned 14 games were ever released in the U.S., along with no CoPilot GPS software, though the software was sold on the British site for a week or two. There was little to no advertising, and some of their advertising was even put in magazines of \"Nintendo Power\" (Nintendo's official magazine). Plans to distribute the handheld through other retailers never materialized.\n\nThe Gizmondo launched in the United Kingdom with only one game, \"Trailblazer\". The console launched in the United States with a line-up of eight titles, including \"Trailblazer\". In addition to these eight, six others were released in Europe only. A further 30 titles were known to have been in development for the system, but all were canceled before their release due to Tiger Telematics' bankruptcy. Also all games released in North America were effectively launch titles.\n\nCertain games were claimed to be capable of using \"augmented reality\", most notably the unreleased game \"Colors\". It was intended to be the first GPS video game, with the ability to track a user's real world movements in real time. Additionally several games including \"Motocross 2005\", \"Hockey Rage 2005\", and \"Sticky Balls\" had bluetooth multiplayer features. The accessibility to purchase Gizmondo games was limited. In the United States, games were only available through a small numbers of kiosks located in shopping malls across the country. After Tiger Telematic's bankruptcy, the Gizmondo and its games were left without any proper marketing or distribution.\n\nFan site Gizmondo Central reviewed all games, and \"Trailblazer\" and \"SSX 3\" had the best score. \"Sticky Balls\" and \"FIFA Football 2005\" were second-best.\nThe \"Smart Adds\" system was intended as a way for advertisers to subsidize part of the cost of the unit. The apparent misspelling of the name was intentional and a trademark and company name were registered in the UK as \"Smart Adds\", though even Tiger Telematics occasionally slipped up and referred to it as Smart Ads in their publicity material. A \"Smart Adds\"-enabled Gizmondo cost less (£129/$229), but would display advertisements on the Gizmondo's screen at random intervals when the user entered the home screen. These advertisements would be downloaded via the device's GPRS data connection, and would be targeted based on data inputted to the device. A maximum of three ads would be shown per day. Some ads would include special offers in the form of vouchers or barcodes, and some would utilize the device's GPS system to direct users to the nearest store carrying the advertised product.\n\nHowever, the \"Smart Adds\" service was never activated, and users who paid the reduced price for a \"Smart Adds\"-enabled device did not receive any advertisements through their device.\n\nFormer Gizmondo director Carl Freer announced to a Swedish newspaper in November 2007 his intentions for a new Gizmondo, and said there were already 35 games in place, a manufacturing base in Shenzhen, China, and that he hoped the handheld would retail at US$99.\n\nThe original planned launch date was May 2008, but this was quickly pushed back to November 2008, along with details of a new company, Media Power, behind the launch, headed by Carl Freer and his Swedish partner Mikael Ljungman, with development apparently proceeding according to the new schedule at least until September. By December 2008, the console had still not appeared, which Freer blamed on the difficult economic conditions. The device was delayed to 2009 as a result. The latest design prototype turned it into a smartphone running both Windows CE or Google Android.\n\nHowever, since then the Media Power website went offline. Co-founder Mikael Ljungman was later arrested, extradited to Denmark and convicted of serious fraud due to his activities at IT Factory. Nothing more has been announced about the device by Freer, effectively confirming its cancellation.\n\nA reference to the Gizmondo is made in the British movie \"Goal!\", when a meeting takes place in a Gizmondo store.\n",

    "text": "Very Small Array\n\nThe Very Small Array (VSA) was a 14-element interferometric radio telescope operating between 26 and 36 GHz that is used to study the cosmic microwave background radiation. It was a collaboration between the University of Cambridge, University of Manchester and the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias (Tenerife), and was located at the Observatorio del Teide on Tenerife. The array was built at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory by the Cavendish Astrophysics Group and Jodrell Bank Observatory, and was funded by PPARC (now STFC). The design was strongly based on the Cosmic Anisotropy Telescope.\n\nThe telescope was comparable in terms of capabilities to several other CMB experiments, including the balloon-based BOOMERanG and MAXIMA, and the ground-based DASI and CBI.\n\nThe telescope consists of 14 elements (yielding 91 baselines), each of which have a horn reflector antenna focusing astrophysical signals into individual receivers (pseudomorphic HFET amplifiers, with a system temperature around 25 K and a physical temperature of 12 K, based on an NRAO design). The separate elements are combined using a correlator to form an aperture synthesis array. The elements are mounted on a tip-table, which is capable of tracking the sky and can tilt up to 35 degrees from the zenith.\n\nThe telescope has been used in three different configurations – \"compact\", \"extended\" and \"super-extended\", each of which differ in the separation distance between the elements (the difference between compact and extended is a factor of 2.25), and the size of the antennas. While the compact array has antennas 143mm in diameter, the extended array uses 322mm diameter antennas. This means that the compact array has a primary beam of 4.5 degrees, and a resolution of 30 arcminutes (multipoles between 100 and 800), while the extended array has a primary beam of 2 degrees, a resolution of 12 arcminutes and can hence observe multipoles between 250 and 1500. The extended array is also a factor of 5 more sensitive than the compact array. The super-extended array will be able to measure multipoles up to 3000, and has 550mm antenna mirrors. The front-end amplifiers were also upgraded.\n\nThe telescope can be tuned to frequencies between 26 and 36 GHz, with 1.5 GHz bandwidth, meaning that the telescope can carry out observations at different frequencies.\n\nIt also includes two 3.7m radio telescopes, also working at 30 GHz, which are dedicated to monitoring foreground sources. These source subtraction dishes were upgraded to more accurate ones following the first series of observations, to allow the monitoring of much weaker sources than previously.\n\nBoth the source subtractor dishes, and the VSA itself, are surrounded by large metal ground shields.\n\nAs the VSA is an interferometer, it directly measures the angular power spectrum of the CMB, rather than having to construct a map of the sky first.\n\nThe fields observed with the VSA were chosen to minimize the amount of bright radio sources and large clusters in the field (the latter to avoid the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect), as well as to avoid contamination by emission from our galaxy. The radio point sources present in the VSA fields were observed with the Ryle Telescope at 15 GHz, then monitored by the VSA source subtracters during the VSA observations.\n\nIn the compact array configuration, the telescope observed three 7×7 degree areas of the sky to high precision in an observing session between August 2000 and August 2001. These observations were taken at the highest frequency of the telescope, centered at 34 GHz, to reduce foreground contamination. Another, larger area of the sky was also observed, but less precisely. The data from these observations were reduced independently at all three involved institutions. The results from these observations were published in a series of four papers in 2003; those by Watson et al., Taylor et al., Scott et al. and Rubino-Martin et al. (see References below). The key results were the power spectra of the Cosmic Microwave Background between multipoles of 150 and 900, and the resulting limits on cosmological parameters when combined with data from observations from other experiments.\n\nThe second observing session ran between September 2001 and July 2003, and was using the extended array. The first results from the extended array were published as a Letter in 2003, simultaneously with the first four publications, using data taken up until April 2002. The sections of the sky observed were located within the previously-observed fields, with the measurements being both more accurate and in greater detail. The result was an improved power spectrum of the CMB, going out to a multipole of 1400, and refined cosmological parameters. The second set of results were published in 2004, and consisted of the original observations plus more observations taken in the same regions of the sky, as well as observations in three new regions. This yielded measurements of the CMB power spectra out to l of 1500 much more accurately than previously, and more accurate cosmological parameter estimates.\n\nObservations with the VSA continued until the end of August 2008, using the Super-Extended configuration. Also, the Ryle Telescope has been upgraded to detect lower flux point sources, and the OCRA receiver on a telescope in Poland will be used to more accurately subtract the point sources.\n\n\n",

Most scholars agree that all three letters are written by the same author, although there is debate on who that author is.\n\nThis epistle unlike the other two is written more as a sermon, one to help strengthen people's faith in Jesus, to help them understand why a being as great as the Son of God would have a mortal life and a mortal's agonizing death.\n\nThis Epistle is written as a short letter from the Apostle to an unnamed \"elect lady\" whom he loves and her children. Within the letter, John warns about opening her home to false teachers and to always practice truth, avoiding secrecy.\n\nThe third epistle, also a short letter, is addressed to a man named Gaius and mentioned as \"a dear friend\". It talks about a man named Diotrephes whom Gaius excommunicated from the church and had gone on to create an anti-missionary sentiment, trying to get the church to stop receiving missionaries. It is believed that the letter was delivered by a third person, Demetrius.\n\n",

It was approved for funding in late 2004, with the aim of having the full telescope operational by 2009. The project was jointly run by Cardiff University, Oxford University, the Cavendish Astrophysics Group and the University of Manchester.\n\nThe Clover Project was meant to consist of two independent telescopes, one operating at 95 GHz with the other operating at both 150 and 225 GHz. Both telescopes were to be sited near the CBI site in the Atacama Desert, Chile. The two telescope receivers would have been large format focal plane arrays of either 100 or 200 bolometric detectors.\n\nThe aim of the experiment was to measure the B-mode polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background between multipoles of 20 and 1000 down to a sensitivity limited by the foreground contamination due to lensing. This would have allowed the detection of primordial gravitational waves in the universe so long as the ratio of scalar perturbations (caused by density fluctuations in the early universe) to the tensor perturbations caused by gravitational waves was greater than formula_1.\n\nIt was hoped that the telescope would have spent around 2 years observing a total of around 1,000 degrees of sky, made up of several patches of sky where polarized foregrounds (synchrotron and thermal dust emission) are at a minimum.\n\nClover was canceled in March 2009 as STFC were unable to provide the requested additional funds of 2.55 million pounds to finish the project.\n\n",

    "text": "Lazistan Sanjak\n\nLazistan ( / \"Lazona\", ლაზეთი / \"Lazeti\", ჭანეთი / \"Ç'aneti\"; , \"Lazistān\") was the Ottoman administrative name for the sanjak, under Trebizond Vilayet, comprising the Laz or Lazuri-speaking population on the southeastern shore of the Black Sea. It covered the land of contemporary Rize Province and the littoral of contemporary Artvin Province.\n\nAfter the Ottoman conquest of Trebizond Empire and later Ottoman invasion of Guria in 1547, Laz populated area known as Lazia became its own distinctive area (sanjak) as part of eyalet of Trabzon, under the administration of a Governor who governed from the town of Rizaion (Rize). His title was \"\"Lazistan Mutasserif\"\"; in other words \"\"Governor of Lazistan\"\". The Lazistan sanjak was divided into cazas, namely those of: Ofi, Rizaion, Athena, Hopa, Gonia and Batum.\n\nNot only the Pashas (governors) of Trabzon until the 19th century, but real authority in many of the \"cazas\" (districts) of each sanjak by the mid-17th century lay in the hands of relatively independent native Laz derebeys (\"valley-lords\"), or feudal chiefs who exercised absolute authority in their own districts, carried on petty warfare with each other, did not owe allegiance to a superior and never paid contributions to the sultan. This state of insubordination was not really broken until the assertion of Ottoman authority during the reforms of the Osman Pasha in 1850s.\n\nIn 1547, Ottomans acquired the coastal fortress of Gonia, which served as capital of Lazistan; then Batum until it was acquired by the Russians in 1878, throughout the Russo-Turkish War, thereafter, Rize became the capital of the sanjak. The Muslim Lazs living near the war zones in Batumi Oblast were subjected to ethnic cleansing; many Lazes living in Batumi fled to the Ottoman Empire, settling along the southern Black Sea coast to the east of Samsun and Marmara region.\n\nAround 1914 Ottoman policy towards the Christian population shifted; state policy was since focused to the forceful migration of Christian Pontic Greek and Laz population living in coastal areas to the Anatolian hinterland. In the 1920s Christian population of the Pontus were expelled to Greece.\n\nIn 1917, after the Russian Revolution, Lazs became citizents of Democratic Republic of Georgia, and eventually became Soviet citizens after the Red Army invasion of Georgia in 1921. Simultaneously, a treaty of friendship was signed in Moscow between Soviet Russia and the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, whereby southern portions of former Batum Oblast - later known as Artvin, was awarded to Turkey, which renounced its claims to Batumi.\n\nThe autonomous Lazistan sanjak existed until the end of the empire in 1923. the designation of the term of Lazistan was officially banned in 1926, by the Kemalists. Lazistan was divided between Rize and Artvin provinces.\n\nThe population of Lazistan was made up of Sunni Muslim Laz, Turks, and Hemshin people. The Christian population were around and made up of Pontic Greeks and Armenian Apostolic Christians.\nThe Ottomans fought for three centuries to destroy the Christian-Georgian consciousness of the Laz people. The execution of the Three Hundred Laz Martyrs took place on Mt. Dudikvati (lit. “the place of beheading”) and on Mt. Papati (lit. “the place of the clergy”) respectively. The beheading of some three hundred Laz warriors on a single mountain between the years 1600 and 1620 and the martyrdom of the clergy at one local monastery was what occurred during this massacre, and resulted in the dissolution of the Clergy and subsequent conversion to Islam or Hellinization of the Laz people. Local orthodox inhabitants, once subordinated to the Georgian Orthodox Church, had to adhere to the rules of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Part of the native population became targets of the Ottoman Islamization policy and gradually converted to Islam, while the second part of the people who remained orthodox subordinated to the Greek Church, thus gradually becoming Greeks as part of the process known as the Hellenization of Laz people. Lazs who were under the control of Constantinople soon lost their language and self-identity as they became Greeks and learned Greek, especially the Pontic dialect of Greek, although the Laz language was preserved by Lazs who had instead become Muslim.\n\nHistorically, Lazistan was known for producing hazelnuts, which were exported to and from Trabzon. Lazistan also produced zinc, producing over 1,700 tons in 1901.\n\n\n",

    "text": "Four-in-hand knot\n\nThe four-in-hand knot is a method of tying a necktie. It is also known as a simple knot or schoolboy knot, due to its simplicity and style. Some reports state that carriage drivers tied their reins with a four-in-hand knot, while others claim that the carriage drivers wore their scarves in the manner of a four-in-hand, but the most likely etymology is that members of the Four-in-Hand Club in London began to wear the neckwear, making it fashionable. The knot produced by this method is on the narrow side, notably asymmetric, and appropriate for most, but not all occasions. For United States Army uniforms, and United States Navy uniforms that include a necktie, the four-in-hand knot is one of three prescribed options for tying the necktie, the other two being the half-Windsor and Windsor.\n\nThe four-in-hand knot is tied by placing the tie around the neck and crossing the broad end of the tie in front of the narrow end. The broad end is folded behind the narrow end and brought forward on the opposite side, passed across the front horizontally, folded behind the narrow end again, brought over the top of the knot from behind, tucked behind the horizontal pass, and the knot pulled snug. The knot is slid up the narrow end of the tie until snug against the collar.\n\nUsing the notation of \"The 85 Ways to Tie a Tie\", by Thomas Fink and Yong Mao, the four-in-hand knot (knot 2) is tied\n\nWhen it's used to attach rope to an object, the four-in-hand knot is known as the \"buntline hitch\". It was used by sailors throughout the age of sail to rig ships and remains a useful working knot today.\n\nA variant of the four-in-hand, with the long end of the tie passed back around and above the just-tied knot, was employed by Aristotle Onassis, who caused it to become briefly fashionable in some circles. Fink and Mao record this variant as Knot 2; in shorthand notation, it is written Li Ro Li Co T Ri Co.\n\n",

The combination of NAPTR records with Service Records (SRV) allows the chaining of multiple records to form complex rewrite rules which produce new domain labels or uniform resource identifiers (URIs).\n\nThe DNS type code for the NAPTR record is 35.\n\nUniform Resource Names (URNs) are a subset of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) used for abstract identifiers, such as a person's name or their telephone number. For URNs to be meaningful, they must be mapped to a concrete resource of some sort. Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) are often used to describe such resources, such as a computer hostname, or a local file.\n\nThe NAPTR record aids in the standardization of URNs. NAPTR records map between sets of URNs, URLs and plain domain names and suggest to clients the protocols available for communication with the mapped resource. Each NAPTR record contains a service name, a set of flags, a regular expression rule, an order value, a preference and a replacement pattern. Multiple records can be chained together in a cascade to rewrite URIs in deterministic ways. These cascading rules have been standardized in RFC2915 and RFC3403.\n\nA common use for NAPTR records is in Session Initiation Protocol, where it is used to route telephony sessions over the IP networks. For example, the SIP URN for the US telephone number 1-800-555-1234 might be tel:+1-800-555-1234 and its domain name 4.3.2.1.5.5.5.0.0.8.1.e164.arpa. A SIP client querying that name might receive:\n\nThe first record has an order value of 100, which is lower than 102 and therefore has precedence. Its preference of 10 is unimportant as there are no other rules with order 100. The service name E2U+sip is an ENUM string indicating that the record can be used in telephone number-to-SIP-URI queries. The client applies the regular expression \"!^.*$!sip:customer-service@example.com!\", which replaces its entire URN \"tel:+1-800-555-1234\" with \"sip:customer-service@example.com\". The flag \"U\" indicates that the replacement string is a SIP URN, and that no further rules should be applied.\n\nTo resolve SIP URN, the client performs a second NAPTR lookup—on \"example.com\", yielding:\n\nAs in the first example, the client picks the first record because it has the lowest order value. The regular expression rule replaces the query URN, this time with the domain name \"_sip._udp.example.com\". The flag \"S\" indicates that the resulting domain name points to a SRV record. The client thus finishes with \"_sip._udp.example.com\", for which it can then fetch a SRV record to initiate a telephony call.\n\nNAPTR implementations generally also implement EDNS as responses returning multiple NAPTR records are usually larger than the normal 512 byte packet size limit and would otherwise require a less efficient fallback to TCP rather than UDP.\n",

He also appeared for teams in five other countries during his career.\n\nDenílson gained more than 60 caps for Brazil, making his full debut before his 20th birthday and representing the nation in six international tournaments, including two World Cups (winning the 2002 edition). Denilson was known for his dribbling skills.\n\nBorn in Diadema, São Paulo, Denílson made his senior debuts with local São Paulo FC at the age of only 17, appearing with the team in the 1994 Copa CONMEBOL and winning the tournament.\n\nIn 1998, he broke the world-record transfer fee when Real Betis paid £21.5 million for his services. He made his La Liga debut on 29 August in a 0–0 away draw against Deportivo Alavés, and finished his first season with 35 games and two goals as his team ranked in 11th position; the Andalusians were relegated to Segunda División in 2000.\n\nDenílson spent some months back in his country with Clube de Regatas do Flamengo, on loan, but returned in January 2001 to be a productive attacking unit for Betis as it achieved promotion back (21 games, one goal). He continued to be regularly played in the following top flight campaigns, but more often than not as a substitute.\n\nIn 2004–05 Betis finished in fourth position and qualified to the UEFA Champions League, also adding the season's Copa del Rey, but Denílson was only a fringe player now, starting in just three games and playing only 290 minutes.\n\nIn the 2005 off-season, Denílson was sold to French club FC Girondins de Bordeaux for an undisclosed amount, four years before his Betis contract was due to expire. In his only season in Ligue 1 he appeared regularly to help to a second-place finish, albeit trailing eventual champions Olympique Lyonnais by 15 points.\n\nAs the team failed to match Denílson's wage demands, he left and signed for Saudi Arabia's Al Nassr FC, where he played for a couple of months.\n\nOn 24 August 2007, he joined FC Dallas of Major League Soccer, becoming the team's designated player. he made his league debut on 1 September, entering in the 55th minute against D.C. United, and the following week he made his first start, against Toronto FC at Pizza Hut Park, scoring from the penalty spot in the 36th minute of an eventual 2–0 win.\n\nAfter only one goal and no assists, Denílson was excluded from Dallas' squad for their appearance in the final of the U.S. Open Cup, raising questions of whether he would remain with the club following the season (even though Open Cup regulations allowed no more than five foreign players on the game-day roster). Further fueling speculation, head coach Steve Morrow said the player would need to \"earn a spot in the starting lineup like everybody else\"; goalkeeper Darío Sala added the team was having problems adjusting to a change in scheme to accommodate Denílson.\n\nAt the end of the season, FC Dallas decided not to pick up its option on Denílson, but stated their desire to resign the winger at a lower salary. In February 2008 he signed a one-year performance-based contract with Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras, hoping the club structure and experienced coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo would help him recover his best football. He was unable to make the starting squad, spending most of the season as a bench option; nonetheless, he helped \"O Verdão\" to the São Paulo State Championship and a berth in the Copa Libertadores after the fourth place in the Série A.\n\nOn 6 January 2009, Denílson was taken on trial by Premier League side Bolton Wanderers with a chance to sign a contract until the end of the campaign. He stated: \"I want to play in Europe, but I am not in a rush. I have received proposals from England, Greece, Turkey and Germany. I am studying them\", further adding: \"I understand that this is the time to return to European football, but if I am not convinced by any offer I hope to continue in Brazil, where there are also clubs interested in me\"; eventually, nothing came of it.\n\nAfter terminating his contract with Palmeiras, 31-year-old Denílson signed a three-month contract with Itumbiara Esporte Clube. On 2 June 2009 he penned a six-month deal with Vietnamese club Hải Phòng F.C. on a pay-as-you-play contract. He made his debut on the 21st against Hoàng Anh Gia Lai FC, scoring through a free kick just two minutes into the game, but left after only three weeks with the team with only that single appearance to his credit due to injury. Denílson was paid $12,000 for the match and a $5,000 bonus for the goal.\n\nIn January 2010, Denílson signed a two-year contract with Kavala F.C. in Greece. He was released on 16 April, without having played any games.\n\nDenílson made his debut for Brazil in November 1996 at the age of 19, against Cameroon. He was called for the squad that competed at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, appearing in all the games for the eventual runners-up; the previous year, he was also selected for the 1997 Copa América and the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup, winning both tournaments and totalling ten appearances (two goals).\n\nDenílson was picked by manager Luiz Felipe Scolari for his 2002 World Cup squad in Japan and South Korea. Always as a substitute, he played in five matches as the \"Seleção\" won its fifth World Cup, appearing one minute in the final against Germany.\n\nAfter Carlos Alberto Parreira returned for his third spell as national team boss, Denílson was not called again. He gained a total of 61 caps.\n\nA creative and technically gifted left-footed player, Denilson was mainly known for his dribbling skills, in particular for his use of several feints to beat opponents such as the \"step over\", which he frequently employed. Despite his talent, he was considered by some to not have fulfilled the potential he showed at the start of his career.\n\nDenílson was sponsored by sportswear company Nike, and appeared in commercials for the brand. In a global advertising campaign in the run-up to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, he starred in a \"Secret Tournament\" commercial (branded \"Scorpion KO\") directed by Terry Gilliam, appearing alongside football players such as Fabio Cannavaro, Hernán Crespo, Edgar Davids, Rio Ferdinand, Luís Figo, Paul Scholes, Thierry Henry, Gaizka Mendieta, Hidetoshi Nakata, Ronaldinho, Ronaldo and Francesco Totti among others, with former player Eric Cantona the tournament \"referee\". In March 2017 Denilson signed with 888poker as a brand ambassador.\n\nAfter retiring, Denílson worked as a sports commentator for Rede Bandeirantes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Pulsed power\n\nPulsed power is the science and technology of accumulating energy over a relatively long period of time and releasing it very quickly, thus increasing the instantaneous power.\n\nEnergy is typically stored within electrostatic fields (capacitors), magnetic fields (inductors), as mechanical energy (using large flywheels connected to special-purpose high-current alternators), or as chemical energy (high-current lead-acid batteries, or explosives). By releasing the stored energy over a very short interval (a process that is called energy compression), a huge amount of peak power can be delivered to a load. For example, if one joule of energy is stored within a capacitor and then evenly released to a load over one second, the average power delivered to the load would only be 1 watt. However, if all of the stored energy were released within one microsecond, the average power over one second would still be one watt, but the instantaneous peak power would be one megawatt, a million times greater. Pulsed power technology is used in radar, particle accelerators, ultrastrong magnetic fields, fusion research, electromagnetic pulses, and high-power pulsed lasers.\n\nPulsed Power was first developed during World War II for use in radar. Radar requires short high-power pulses. After the war, development continued in other applications, leading to the super pulsed power machines at Sandia National Laboratories.\n\n\n",

    "text": "Navy Precision Optical Interferometer\n\nThe Navy Precision Optical Interferometer (NPOI) is an American astronomical interferometer, with the world's largest baselines, operated by the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS) in collaboration with the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and Lowell Observatory. The NPOI primarily produces space imagery and astrometry, the latter a major component required for the safe position and navigation of all manner of vehicles for the DoD. The facility is located at Lowell's Anderson Mesa Station on Anderson Mesa about southeast of Flagstaff, Arizona (US). Until November 2011, the facility was known as the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer (NPOI). Subsequently, the instrument was temporarily renamed the Navy Optical Interferometer, and now permanently, the Kenneth J. Johnston Navy Precision Optical Interferometer (NPOI) – reflecting both the operational maturity of the facility, and paying tribute to its principal driver and retired founder, Kenneth J. Johnston.\n\nThe NPOI project was initiated by the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) in 1987. Lowell joined the project the following year when the USNO decided to build the NPOI at Anderson Mesa. The first phase of construction was completed in 1994, which allowed the interferometer to see its first fringes, or light combined from multiple sources, that year. The Navy began regular science operations in 1997. The NPOI has been continuously upgraded and expanded since then, and has been operational for a decade. The workings of NPOI as a classic interferometer, are described at Scholarpedia, and at the NPOI site.\n\nThe NPOI is an astronomical interferometer laid out in a three-arm \"Y\" configuration, with each equally-spaced arm measuring long. There are two types of stations that can be used in the NPOI. Astrometric stations, used to measure the positions of celestial objects very accurately, are fixed units placed apart, with one on each arm and one at the center. Imaging stations can be moved to one of nine positions on each arm, and up to six can be used at one time to perform standard observing. Light from either type of station is first directed into the feed system, which consists of long pipes which have been evacuated of all air. They lead to a switchyard of mirrors, where the light is directed into the six Long Delay Lines, which is another set of long pipes that compensate for the different distances to each station. The light is then sent into the Beam Combining Facility, where it enters the Fast Delay Lines. This third set of evacuated pipes contains mechanisms that move mirrors back and forth with a very high degree of accuracy. These compensate for the movement of the mirrors as they track an object across the sky, and for other effects. Finally, the light leaves the pipes inside the BCF and goes to the Beam Combining Table, where the light is combined in a way that allows images to be formed.\nBoth types of station have three elements: a siderostat, a Wide Angle Star Acquisition (WASA) camera, and a Narrow Angle Tracking (NAT) mirror. The first is a precisely-ground flat mirror in diameter. The WASA cameras control the aiming of the mirror at the celestial target. The reflected light from the siderostat is directed through a telescope which narrows the beam down to the diameter of the pipes, which is . The light then hits the mirror of the NAT, which compensates for atmospheric effects and directs the light into the feed system.\n\nIn 2009 NOFS began final plans for NPOI to incorporate four aperture optical-infrared telescopes into the array, which were accepted by the Navy in 2010, and assigned to the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station. They were originally intended to be \"outrigger\" telescopes for the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, but were never installed and incorporated into Keck's interferometer. Three telescopes are being prepared for near-immediate installation, while the fourth is currently at Mount Stromlo Observatory in Australia and will be incorporated at some point in the future. The new telescopes will help with faint object imaging and improved absolute astrometry, due to their greater light-gathering abilities than the existing siderostats.\n\nNOFS operates and leads the science for the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer, as noted, in collaboration with Lowell Observatory and the Naval Research Laboratory at Anderson Mesa. NOFS funds all principal operations, and from this contracts Lowell Observatory to maintain the Anderson Mesa facility and make the observations for NOFS to conduct the primary astrometry. The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) also provides funds to contract Lowell Observatory's and NRL's implementation of additional, long-baseline siderostat stations, facilitating NRL's primary scientific work, synthetic imaging (both celestial and of orbital satellites). When complete by 2013, NPOI will run the longest baseline interferometer in the world. The three institutions - USNO, NRL, and Lowell - each provide an executive to sit on an Operational Advisory Panel (OAP), which collectively guides the science and operations of the interferometer. The OAP commissioned the chief scientist and director of the NPOI to effect the science and operations for the Panel; this manager is a senior member of the NOFS staff and reports to the NOFS Director.\n\nNPOI is an example of the Michelson Interferometer design, with the principal science managed by NOFS. Lowell Observatory and NRL join in the scientific efforts through their fractions of time to use the interferometer; science time is 85% Navy (NOFS and NRL); and 15% Lowell. NPOI is one of the few major instruments globally which can conduct \"optical\" interferometry. See an illustration of its layout, at bottom. NOFS has used NPOI to conduct a wide and diverse series of scientific studies, beyond just the study of absolute astrometric positions of stars,; additional NOFS science at NPOI includes the study of binary stars, Be Stars, Oblate stars, rapidly rotating stars, those with starspots, and the imaging of stellar disks (the first in history) and flare stars. In 2007–2008, NRL with NOFS used NPOI to obtain first-ever closure phase image precursors of satellites orbiting in geostationary orbit.\n\nInstallation plans for a 1m Array have been developed by NRL and Lowell Observatory, based on the funded science performed.\n\nOptical interferometers are extremely complex, unfilled aperture photon-collecting telescopes in the visual (sometimes the near infrared, too), which produce synthesized images and fringe data \"on the fly\" (unlike radio interferometers which are privileged to record the data for \"later\" synthesis), essentially by taking an inverse Fourier transform of the incoming data. Astrometry is understood by precisely measuring delay line additions while fringing, to match the light path differences from baseline ends. Using essentially trigonometry the angle and position of where the array is 'pointed' can be determined, thus inferring a precise position on the sphere of the sky.\n\nOnly a few exist that can be considered operational. To date NPOI has produced the highest resolution optical images of any astronomical instrument, though this may change when the CHARA array and Magdalena Ridge Observatory Interferometer begin optical-band operations. The first astronomical object imaged (resolved) by NPOI was Mizar, and since, a significant amount of astrometry, reference tie frame, rapid rotator star, and Be stellar disk study has been performed. NPOI is capable of determining positions of celestial objects to a few milli-arcsecond, in part due to the optical anchoring of its components using a complex metrology array of lasers that connect main optical elements to each other and to bedrock.\n\nMany specialized lasers are also used to align the long train of optics. The current NPOI siderostat array remains the world's only long-baseline (437-meter) optical interferometer that can simultaneously co-phase six elements. NPOI is expected to grow significantly in capability with the pending addition of four 1.8-meter aperture IR/Optical telescopes into the current array. The enhanced array will also employ adaptive optics techniques. This layout and increased sparse aperture will permit significant improvements to the science capability, from a tenfold increase in measuring ever-fainter wide-angle astrometry targets, to improved positional determination for numerous binary and flare stars. When the 1.8m telescope addition are complete, NPOI also will undertake additional studies of dust and proto-planetary disks, and planetary systems and their formation.\n\n\n",

    "text": "Parker Vacumatic\n\nThe Parker Vacumatic fountain pen was launched in 1932, and would come to out-sell the Parker Duofold, the then top seller. The pen was originally marketed under the name of Golden Arrow, a reference to the new arrow clip but was again changed to Vacuum Filler in reference to its ink reservoir filling action.\n\nThe Vacumatic featured a brand new filling mechanism which took 5 years to develop at a cost of $125,000. Parker boasted the model to be the first self-filler without a sac; while this was not entirely true, the filling mechanism was still a great innovation.\nBy using a diaphragm rather than a sac, the whole barrel can be used as a reservoir. The principle workings are essentially like that of the earlier button fillers like the Duofold as the depression of the plunger pushed on the rubber sac and forced out the air (creating a vacuum) and when the rubber regained its natural form the ink got sucked into the pen to replace the air. The difference was that the previous button was replaced with a fat (approximately 4 mm) plunger that was used to operate the diaphragm. The plunger could be locked in a down position with a twist of the thumb and is referred to as the Lock-Down Fill, or Twist-Fill.\n\nAlthough the pen came in many sizes and colors, the most widely recognizable Vacumatics featured alternating horizontal bands of pearlescent and clear celluloid. These clear bands allowed the user to see the level of ink in the barrel.\n\nSeveral generations of Vacumatic were produced.\n\nThe pen remained Parker’s top-of-the-line product until the launch of the 51 in 1941. The Parker Vacumatic was phased out in 1948 but remained in production in Canada until 1953.\n",

    "text": "Konstantin Petrovich von Kaufmann\n\nKonstantin Petrovich Kaufman (; 2 March 1818 – 16 May 1882), better known as Konstantin Petrovich von Kaufmann, was the first Governor-General of Russian Turkestan.\n\nHis family was German in origin (from Holstein), but had been in the service of the Tsars for over 100 years, and had since converted to Orthodoxy. Kaufmann graduated from Nikolayev Engineering Institute, now Military Engineering-Technical University (Russian ), as a military engineer. Kaufman entered the military engineering field in 1838, served in the campaigns in the Caucasus, was promoted to the rank of colonel, and commanded the sappers at the siege of Kars in 1855. On the capitulation of Kars he was deputed to settle the terms with General William Fenwick Williams.\n\nIn 1861, he became director-general of engineers at the War Office, assisting Count Dmitry Milyutin, the Minister of War, in the reorganization of the army. Promoted lieutenant general in 1864, he became Governor-General of Vilna, where at that time the Tsarist state had begun a policy of expropriating the Polish aristocracy in an attempt to break its influence in the countryside.\n\nAt the high point of the Russian conquest of Turkestan, in 1867, he became Governor-General of the new province of Turkestan, and held the post until his death, making himself a name in the expansion of the empire in Central Asia. The western part of the Khanate of Kokand along the Syr Darya had already been captured, and the independence of the rest of that country became merely nominal. He accomplished a successful campaign in 1868 against the Emirate of Bukhara, capturing Samarkand and gradually subjugating the whole country. \n\nDuring the Khivan campaign of 1873, he attacked Khanate of Khiva, took the capital, and forced the Khan to become a vassal of Russia. This was followed in 1875 by the campaign against Kokand, in which Kaufman defeated the uprising khan, Nasreddin, after an anti-Russian uprising against the previous ruler, Khudoyar. The fiction of Kokand's independence was ended, and the remaining rump of the Khanate in the Ferghana Valley was annexed. This rapid absorption of these Khanates brought Russia into proximity to Afghanistan, and the reception of Kaufmann's emissaries by the Sher Ali Khan was a main cause of the Second Anglo-Afghan War.\n\nThe various temporary statutes under which Turkestan was administered from 1867-1886 gave von Kaufmann a great deal of latitude in policy. In 1868 he contacted experts in Moscow to identify Alexie (and Olga Fedchenko) to create an expedition to document the countries natural history.\n\nWhilst Kaufmann was still extending the borders of the Russian Empire, he was creating a team to investigate and document the new territory. Kaufmann's team included statisticians, the Fedchenkos, the war artist Vasily Vereshchagin and later the educationalist Nikolai Ostroumov. Kaufman wanted an investigation of a \"newly and scarcely explored region\". Kaufmann set up a Tashkent outpost of the Moscow Society of Devotees of Natural Science, Anthropology, and Ethnography (OLEAE). The Fenchenkos made three separate explorations between 1868 and 1872. These investigations were central to the Governor-General's policy as he wanted to see this information shared with Russians as well as locals The local newspaper was used to publish the scientific findings. Kaufmann targeted the 1872 Moscow All-Russian Technical Exhibition as an opportunity to display the research of this new part of the Russian empire.\n\nKaufmann was allowed to carry out administrative negotiations with neighbouring states on his own account, to establish and oversee the expenditure of the budget, set taxes, and establish the privileges of Russian subjects in the \"General-Gubernatorstvo\"; he also had the power to confirm and revoke death sentences passed in the Russian military courts. Nowhere else in the Russian Empire did a Military Governor-General have this kind of independence from central control, and nowhere else was there such obvious pessimism about the region’s potential for integration into the main body of the Empire. Isolated geographically from European Russia by an expanse of Steppe that took two months to cross, it was isolated still more decisively in the minds of Tsarist officials by its dense, ancient and settled Islamic culture. In its early years under Kaufmann, Turkestan was thus also administratively isolated, with many distinctive institutions within the military bureaucracy, that was loosely superimposed on a largely unreformed native administration.\n\nAlthough Kaufmann was unable to induce his government to support all his ambitious schemes of further conquest, he was still in office when General Mikhail Skobelev, the hero of the Russo-Turkish war of 1877, was despatched from Tiflis in 1880 and 1881 against the Turkomans of the Akhal-Teke Oasis. Skobelev, although being the effective military governor of the Fergana valley, directing matters from Margelan and New Margelan, was cut short in this second campaign of his in the area. He was recalled. (On 7 July 1882, while staying at a Moscow hotel, on his way to his estate, he died suddenly of a heart attack, shortly before the annexation of Merv). General Chernyayev, the conqueror of Tashkent in 1865, was appointed as his successor.\n\nThere are various species of plants are named after him including \"Eremurus kaufmannii\", \"Eremostachys kaufmanniana\", \"Tulipa kaufmanniana\", \"Gentiana kaufmanniana\", and \"Statice kaufmanniana\".\n\n",

    "text": "Consider Her Ways\n\nConsider Her Ways is a 1956 science fiction novella by John Wyndham. It was published as part of a 1961 collection with some short stories called \"Consider Her Ways and Others\" (where it forms over a third of the book). The title is from Proverbs, Chapter 6, verse 6: \"Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise\".\n\nThe story is mostly a first-person narrative. It begins with a woman (Jane Waterleigh) who has no memory of her past waking up and discovering that she is a mother of some description, in a bloated body that is not her own. After some confusing experiences Jane's memory gradually returns and she recalls that she was part of an experiment using a drug (chuinjuatin) to see if it enabled people to have out-of-body experiences. It seems that the drug has worked far better than anyone could have anticipated: Jane has been cast into the future. She also realises that she is in a society consisting entirely of women, organised into a strict system of castes, and that she is now a member of the mother caste. Jane's initial contacts have never even heard of men, and believe her to be delusional.\n\nWhen it becomes clear to doctors who attend Jane that something strange has happened (since she can read and write, while the mother caste are illiterate) they arrange for her to be taken to meet an aged historian named Laura. It seems that Jane is in a society somewhat more than a century after her own time. Laura relates that not long after Jane's own time a Dr Perrigan carried out scientific experiments that unintentionally created a virus that killed all the men in the world, leaving only women. After a very difficult period of famine and breakdown, a small number of educated women, found mainly in the medical profession, took control and embarked on an urgent programme of research to enable women to reproduce without males. The women also decided to follow some advice from the Bible (\"Go to the ant thou sluggard, consider her ways\") and created a caste-based society in which Jane has become a member of the Mother caste.\n\nLaura does understand what Jane means when she talks of men. However, she is certain that they were oppressors of women and that the world is far better without them. Jane disagrees and feels the demise of men to be a terrible blow.\n\nDistressed at the prospect of spending her life as a bloated producer of babies, expected to be unable to read, write or reason, Jane requests that she be administered a dose of chuinjuatin in the hope that she might return to her own time. It works, and once transported, Jane decides to stop Dr Perrigan at all costs. The story has an ambiguous ending, which may suggest that it is the narrator's own actions that will lead to the catastrophe she hopes to prevent, an example of the predestination paradox.\n\n\n\"Consider Her Ways\" was an episode of \"The Alfred Hitchcock Hour\" in 1964. This was a fairly faithful adaptation of Wyndham's story, although somewhat condensed and with the action moved to America. The screenplay was written by Oscar Millard, and it starred Barbara Barrie as the woman who travels through time and Gladys Cooper as the historian.\n\n",

    "text": "Demographics of Paris\n\nThe city of Paris (also called the Commune or Department of Paris) had a population of 2,241,346 people within its administrative city limits as of January 1, 2014. It is surrounded by the Paris \"unité urbaine\", or urban area, the most populous urban area in the European Union. In 2011 the \"unité urbaine\" had a population of 10,516,110. The Paris Region, or Île-de-France covers 12,012 square kilometers (4,638 square miles), and has its own regional council and president. It has a population of 12,005,077 as of January 2014, or 18.2 percent of the population of France.\n\nThe population of the city of Paris reached a historic high of 2.9 million in 1921 but then declined; between 1954 and 1999 it declined at every census, falling to 2,147,857 in 1999, but after that it began to climb again, reaching 2,234,000 by 2009.\n\nThe city's population loss reflected the experience of most other core cities in the developed world that have not expanded their boundaries. The principal factors in the process were a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included deindustrialisation, high rent, the gentrification of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The city's population loss was one of the most severe among international municipalities and the largest for any that had achieved more than 2,000,000 residents. Since then an influx of younger residents and immigrants has contributed to the growth of the city.\n\nAccording to Eurostat, the EU statistical agency, in 2012 the Commune of Paris was the most densely populated city in the European Union, with 21,616 people per square kilometre within the city limits (the NUTS-3 statistical area), ahead of Inner London West, which had 10,374 persons per square kilometre. According to the same census, three departments bordering Paris, Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne, had population densities of over ten thousand persons per square kilometre, ranking among the ten most densely populated areas of the EU.\n\nParis is one of the most densely populated cities in the world. Its density, excluding the outlying woodland parks of Boulogne and Vincennes, was in the 1999 official census, which could be compared only with some Asian megapolises and the New York City borough of Manhattan. Even including the two woodland areas, its population density was , the fifth-most-densely populated commune in France after Le Pré-Saint-Gervais, Vincennes, Levallois-Perret, and Saint-Mandé—all of which border the city proper.\n\nThe most sparsely populated quarters are the western and central office and administration-focused \"arrondissements\". The city's population is densest in the northern and eastern arrondissements; the 11th arrondissement had a density of in 1999, and some of the same arrondissement's eastern quarters had densities close to in the same year.\n\nThe city of Paris covers an area much smaller than the urban area of which it is the core. At present, Paris's real urbanisation, defined by the pôle urbain (urban cluster) statistical area, covers , or an area about 27 times larger than the city itself. The administration of Paris's urban growth is divided between itself and its surrounding departments: Paris's closest ring of three adjoining departments, or petite couronne (\"small ring\") are fully saturated with urban growth, and the ring of four departments outside of these, the grande couronne departments, are only covered in their inner regions by Paris's urbanisation. These eight departments form the larger administrative Île-de-France région; most of this region is filled, and overextended in places, by the Paris aire urbaine, which, in 2010, was populated by over 12 million people.\n\nThe Paris agglomeration has shown a steady rate of growth since the end of the late 16th century French Wars of Religion, save brief setbacks during the French Revolution and World War II. Suburban development has accelerated in recent years: With an estimated total of 11.4 million inhabitants for 2005, the Île-de-France région shows a rate of growth double that of the 1990s.\n\nBy law, French censuses do not ask questions regarding ethnicity or religion, but do gather information concerning one's country of birth. From this it is still possible to determine that Paris and its metropolitan area is one of the most multi-cultural in Europe: According to the 2011 census, 456,105 residents of the municipality of Paris, or 20.3 percent, and 2,117,901 residents of the Paris Region (Île-de-France), or 17.9 percent, were born outside France. At the 1999 census, 4.2% of the population in Paris metropolitan area were recent immigrants (people who had immigrated to France between 1990 and 1999), the majority from Asia and Africa. 37 per cent of all immigrants in France live in the Paris region.\n\nThe first wave of international migration to Paris started as early as 1820 with the arrivals of German peasants fleeing an agricultural crisis in their homeland. Several waves of immigration followed continually until today: Italians and central European Jews during the 19th century; Russians after the revolution of 1917 and Armenians fleeing genocide in the Ottoman Empire; colonial subjects during World War I and later; Poles between the two world wars; Spaniards, Italians, Portuguese, and North Africans from the 1950s to the 1970s; North African Jews after the independence of those countries; Africans and Asians since then.\n\nThe Paris metropolitan region or \"aire urbaine\" is estimated to be home to some 1.7 million Muslims, making up between 10–15 per cent of the area's population. However, without official data, the margin of error of these estimates is extremely high as it is based on one's country of birth (someone born in a Muslim country or born to a parent from a Muslim country is considered as a \"potential Muslim\"). According to the North American Jewish Data Bank, an estimated 310,000 Jews also live in Paris and the surrounding Île-de-France region, an area with a population of 11.7 million inhabitants. Paris has historically been a magnet for immigrants, hosting one of the largest concentrations of immigrants in Europe today.\n\nAnch National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies, responsible for the production and analysis of official statistics in France, 20 per cent of people living in the city of Paris are immigrants and 41.3 per cent of people under 20 have at least one immigrant parent. Among the young people under 18, 12.1 per cent are of Maghrebi origin, 9.9 per cent of Subsaharan African origin and 4.0 per cent of South European origin. About four million people, or 35 per cent of the population of the Île-de-France, are either immigrants (17 per cent) or have at least one immigrant parent (18 per cent).\n\nReading: 436 576 immigrants live in Paris, representing 20% of Parisians and 22.4% of immigrants in Île-de-France.\n162 635 children under 20 with at least one immigrant parent live in Paris, representing 41.3 per cent of the total of children under 20 in Paris and 15.4 per cent of the total of children under 20 with at least one immigrant parent in Île-de-France.\n\nAs of 2005 many expatriates settle in the western portion of Paris. Western Paris is in close proximity to many international schools and the La Défense area.\n\nAs of 2012 tens of thousands of people of African origins live in Paris. This group includes those born in France who had African parents and naturalized French citizens born in Africa. The majority come from the Maghreb, including Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia. Other countries with populations in Paris include Burkina Faso, the Congo, Guinea, Mali, and Senegal.\n\nAs of 1998 Île-de-France has half of the Asian population of France. As of 1990 the majority of Asians living in France are ethnic Chinese originating from several countries.\n\nIn 1974 France stopped allowing foreign workers into its borders. The Asian population of France increased despite the closure. In 1975 there were 20,000 Asians in Île-de-France. In 1982 the region had 59,000. This increased to 108,000 in 1990.\n\nIn France the \"Asians\" are defined as people originating from the East Asian cultural sphere. The term does not include people from the Indian subcontinent. The usage of \"Asians\" differs from that of Anglo-Saxon countries.\n\nFor the entire Île-de-France region, there were a total of 108,511 persons who held or formerly held Cambodian, Chinese, Laotian, Taiwanese, and Vietnamese citizenships as of 1990. This included 64,361 current citizens of those countries and 44,150 former citizens who became naturalized as French citizens.\n\nAs of 1990, there were a combined total of 31,773 persons who held or formerly held Cambodian, Chinese, Laotian, Taiwanese, and Vietnamese citizenships in the City of Paris. This included 21,655 current citizens of those countries and 10,118 former citizens who became naturalized as French citizens.\n\nAs of 1990 fewer than 10,000 persons of East/Southeast Asian origin resided in six communes of Marne-la-Vallée. 26% of the population of Lognes was Asian, and other percentages were 8% in Noisiel, 5-6% in Noisy-le-Grand, and 5-6% in Torcy. In 1982 there were 6,000 Asians in Marne-la-Vallée, making up 3-4% of the area's population. In 1987 the number increased to 9,000.\n\nAs of circa 1998 Ivry-sur-Seine and Vitry-sur-Seine had a combined Asian population of 3,600.\n\nAs of circa 1998 there were about 6,000 East/Southeast Asians in and around Aulnay-sous-Bois, and there were 3,000 persons of East and Southeast Asian origin in Aulnay proper. Most of them were of Cambodian origin, including those with and without Cambodian citizenship. The commune also had an above-average number of persons of Laotian origin, including those with and without Laotian citizenship. Ethnicities included Khmer people, Lao people, and Overseas Chinese.\n\nAs of 1990, in the City of Paris there were 7,950 Cambodian citizens and 3,279 former Cambodian citizens who became naturalized as French. The combined total is 11,229.\n\nThat year, in the Île-de-France region there were 26,553 Cambodian citizens and 13,068 former Cambodian citizens naturalized as French. The combined total was 39,421.\n\nAs of 1990 the majority of Asians living in the Paris area are ethnic Chinese originating from several countries. The largest group includes ethnic Chinese from Indochina, and a smaller group originates from Zhejiang.\n\nAs of 2013 the official number of Japanese residents in Paris was 16,277.\n\nAs of 1990, in the City of Paris there were 2,185 Laotian citizens and 1,376 former Laotian citizens naturalized as French, making a combined total of 3,561.\n\nAs of that year, in the Île-de-France region there were 10,110 Laotian citizens and 8,177 former Laotian citizens, making a combined total of 18,287.\n\nIn periods before 1975 several Vietnamese arrived in Paris, including intellectuals, those who worked as civil servants in colonial times, and those who came to Paris to study and did not return home. Ethnic Vietnamese arriving after 1975 became a part of an ethnic network established by those that came before them. Many Vietnamese achieved proficiency in the medical, scientific, and computer science fields.\n\nAs of 1990, in the City of Paris there were 3,802 Vietnamese citizens and 4,155 former Vietnamese citizens naturalized as French, making a total of 7,957.\n\nAs of that year, in the Île-de-France region there were 16,387 Vietnamese citizens and 20,261 former Vietnamese citizens naturalized as French, making a total of 36,648.\n\nNotes for the table:\n\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Gaizka Mendieta\n\nGaizka Mendieta Zabala (, ; born 27 March 1974) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a midfielder.\n\nA versatile player, with good technique, offensive capabilities and tackling skills, who was capable of creating goals both for his teammates and himself, he played mainly for Valencia, and finished his career with Middlesbrough in England. Over the course of ten seasons, he amassed La Liga totals of 263 games and 48 goals.\n\nMendieta played 40 times for Spain, appearing for the country in one World Cup and one European Championship.\n\nBorn in Bilbao, Basque Country, Mendieta made his professional debut at just 17 with CD Castellón in Segunda División, featuring mostly as a full-back.\n\nAfter just one season he moved to La Liga after signing with Valencia CF for 30 million pesetas, but spent the vast majority of his first year with the reserves, making his first team debut on 13 June 1993 against Cádiz CF; he played 34 of 42 games during the 1995–96 season as the latter finished runners-up, their best result since 1990.\n\nThe 1997–98 campaign was Mendieta's breakthrough season, under new manager Claudio Ranieri. Moving to a central midfield role he played 30 league matches and scored ten goals, soon making his debut for the national team. In June 1999 he won his first trophy with the club, beating Atlético Madrid in the Copa del Rey; he found the net in wins over Levante UD, FC Barcelona (both legs) and Real Madrid during the run to the final, where he scored a memorable goal: controlling a cross on his chest, he flicked the ball over his own head and two defenders before turning to volley past the goalkeeper.\n\nUnder new manager Héctor Cúper, Mendieta had an even better year in 1999–2000. He helped Valencia beat Barcelona 4–3 on aggregate to win the Supercopa de España, and netted a career-best 13 goals as the \"Che\" finished third. However, the biggest triumph of the season was helping his team reach the final of the season's UEFA Champions League, a 0–3 loss to fellow league side Real Madrid; later, he was awarded the \"European Midfielder of the Season\" award.\n\nValencia reached the final of the Champions League in the following year and lost it again, this time to FC Bayern Munich after a penalty shootout. Mendieta scored an early penalty in normal time to give his team a 1–0 lead, and also converted his attempt in the shootout, being again named \"UEFA Best Midfielder of the Year\".\n\nMendieta was one of the most sought-after players in the 2001 off-season, eventually earning a €47.7 million transfer (or a reported 8 billion pesetas) to Italian club S.S. Lazio, being at the time the sixth most expensive player of all time. However, he disappointed in Serie A, spending only one year in Rome while failing to match the performances of departed playmakers Pavel Nedvěd and Juan Sebastián Verón.\n\nMendieta was loaned to Barcelona for the 2002–03 season– he started most of the fixtures, but the Catalans could only rank sixth – and subsequently he moved to Middlesbrough, choosing the Premier League club over offers from his homeland (Atlético Madrid and Athletic Bilbao) due to a desire to play in England.\n\nIn his first season at Middlesbrough, Mendieta was part of the team that won the Football League Cup, bringing the Teesside club its first ever silverware. At the end of the season, the move was made permanent with no transfer fee involved.\n\nIn his last two years, a string of injuries (including one which caused him to miss the 2006 UEFA Cup Final) and long spells of regaining match fitness relegated Mendieta to the substitutes bench. He fell out of favour with manager Gareth Southgate, who made it clear that the player no longer featured in his first team plans. Reports suggested that Real Sociedad, Athletic Bilbao and Málaga CF were interested in purchasing the midfielder in the January 2007 transfer window, however no concrete agreement was ever made, and the transfer deadline passed amid speculation that the player was set for a move to Los Angeles Galaxy; towards its end, he was quoted to have said that he would fight for his place at Middlesbrough. A day later, \"Boro's\" chief executive Keith Lamb disregarded his comments saying that there was \"no chance\" of him featuring in the first team. He played his last game on 26 December 2006, against Everton.\n\nOn 5 December 2007, according to a Spanish newspaper, Mendieta announced his retirement from professional football when his Middlesbrough contract expired at the end of the 2007–08 season, He was finally released on 13 May 2008, ending a successful 17-year professional career.\n\nOn 3 November 2009, Mendieta was quoted as saying a part of him would be interested in football management when interviewed by the BBC. He said: \"A part of me can see the excitement and challenge of being a manager, definitely.\" After retiring, he settled with his family near Middlesbrough, in Yarm.\n\nIn March/May 1996, Mendieta was part of the Spain under-21 team which was runner-up in the UEFA European Championship. He made his senior side debut on 27 March 1999, coming on as a substitute for Juan Carlos Valerón in a 9–0 thrashing of Austria for UEFA Euro 2000's qualifying stages; he was included in the list of 22 for the competition in Belgium and the Netherlands, helping the national side reach the last eight.\n\nDespite his form slump at Lazio, Mendieta was picked for the squad at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, scoring one goal in three matches for the eventual quarter-finalists, against South Africa (3–2 win). The last of his 40 caps was earned in a friendly with Bulgaria in Granada, four months after the World Cup.\n\nMendieta also featured and scored for the unofficial Basque Country regional team.\n\nMendieta was sponsored by sportswear company Nike, and appeared in commercials for the brand. In a global advertising campaign in the run-up to the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan, he starred in a \"Secret Tournament\" commercial (branded \"Scorpion KO\") directed by Terry Gilliam, appearing alongside footballers such as Luís Figo, Thierry Henry, Hidetoshi Nakata, Roberto Carlos, Ronaldinho, Ronaldo and Francesco Totti, with former player Eric Cantona the tournament \"referee\".\n\nMendieta also worked as a pundit on Sky Sports' UK television coverage of Spanish football.\n\nMendieta's father Andrés was also a footballer who played as a goalkeeper. Originally from Lekeitio, Biscay, he spent his final years as a player at Castellón and later worked on the club's staff, raising his family in the region. Thus, Gaizka emerged through their youth system despite his Basque birthplace.\n\nFellow Bilbao-born Spain internationals Ander Herrera and Roberto Ríos had similar origins, learning their skills in the cities where their footballing fathers (Pedro and Eusebio respectively) were based professionally. However, both later signed for Athletic Bilbao, while Mendieta never featured for a Basque club; him and his father both represented Spain at the Olympic Games tournament, the later in 1968 and the former in 1996.\n\nMendieta was a talented athlete as a youth and came close to pursuing middle-distance running as a career over football. He was a fan of music, and in particular had a passion for DJ-ing; he also appeared on-stage at the Benicàssim festival in 2015 during a set by the band Los Planetas, whose song referenced him in its lyrics.\n\nMendieta stated that Ruud Gullit was his footballing hero as an adolescent, due to the Dutchman's unconventional style.\n\nValencia\n\nMiddlesbrough\n\nSpain U21\n\n\n",

    "text": "Ó Flaithbheartaigh\n\nO'Flaherty (Middle Irish: \"Ó Flaithbheartaigh\"; Modern Irish: \"Ó Flaithearta\"), is an Irish Gaelic clan based most prominently in what is today County Galway. The clan name originated in the 10th century as a derivative of its founder Flaithbheartach mac Eimhin. They descend in the paternal line from the Connachta's Uí Briúin Seóla. They were originally kings of Maigh Seóla and Muintir Murchada and as members of the Uí Briúin were kinsmen of the Ó Conchubhair and Mac Diarmada amongst others. After their king Cathal mac Tigernán lost out to Áed in Gai Bernaig in the 11th century, the family were pushed further west to Iar Connacht, a territory associated with Connemara today. They continued to rule this land until the 16th century.\n\nThis Gaelic-Irish surname is written as \"Ua Flaithbertach\" (nominative) or \"Ua Flaithbertaig\" (genitive) in Old Irish and Middle Irish texts. In Modern Irish the surname is now generally spelt as Ó Flatharta.\n\nThe surname is commonly translated as \"bright ruler\" or more correctly \"bright prince\", flaith originally meaning prince in Irish. \"O\" or Ó comes from Ua, designating \"grandson\" or \"descendant\" of a (major) clan member. The prefix is often anglicised to O', using an apostrophe instead of the Irish \"síneadh fada\": \"'\".\n\nMaigh Seóla was the earliest O'Flaherty domain, to the east of Lough Corrib in the kingdom of Connacht, the westernmost province of the Island of Ireland (Irish: Éire).\n\nThe Ó Flaithbertaighs are a branch of the \"Muintir Murchada\" dynasty, named after Murchadh mac Maenach (died 891), King of the Uí Briúin Seóla. Murchadh is one of the earliest attested kings of his region. The leading family of this dynasty would take the surname Ó Flaithbheartaigh (O'Flaherty) from the 11th century onwards.\n\nIn Ulster, the \"F\" is aspirated causing the name to be Anglicised as Laverty etc.\n\nThe Uí Briúin Seóla was one of the major branches of the powerful Uí Briúin dynasty, which had become the dominant force in Connacht by the 8th century. The genealogies list two sons of Murchadh mac Maenach: Urchadh and Urumhain. Urchadh mac Murchadh, King of Maigh Seóla (also listed as king of Iarthair Connacht, died 945, in the 14th century Book of Ballymote) was father of Bé Binn inion Urchadh, Princess of the Uí Briúin Seóla and Queen of Thomond (fl. early 10th century). Bé Binn married Cennétig mac Lorcáin of Thomond to produce a son who would become the High King of Ireland (Irish: Ard-Rí na hÉireann): Brian Bóruma mac Cennétig, known in English as Brian Boru (c. 941–23 April 1014). Brian broke the near monopoly of the Uí Néill over the High Kingship of Ireland and fought to unite Ireland as a people under one, native king. His father, Cennétig mac Lorcáin of Thomond, was one of the principal leaders of the resistance to the Danish Viking incursions. Cennétig had several wives and children but positively assigned Bé Binn as the mother of Brian Bóruma.\n\nBé Binn's sister Creassa inion Urchadh was a wife of King Tadg mac Cathail of Connacht, while her sister, Caineach inion Urchadh, married the ancestor of the Clann Coscraig sept of the Uí Briúin Seóla. Her brother, Donnchadh mac Urchadh succeeded their father as King of Maigh Seóla (943–959).\n\nLike the Uí Briúin Seóla, the Uí Briúin Ai were a major branch of the Uí Briúin dynasty, from whom the high medieval Ua Conchobair (O'Connor) kings of Connacht, including the last high king of Ireland, Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, were descended.\n\nThe Ó Flaithbertaigh family line and kingship can be traced back to Brión mac Echach Muigmedóin, King of Connacht, who was the half-brother of Niall of the Nine Hostages. Their father, Eochaid Muigh Meadhoin mac Muiredach, was, according to legend, also 122nd High King of Ireland and was a direct descendant of Galamh Milesius (c. 1763 BCE – c. 1699 BCE). Galamh Milesius's bloodline produced kings in succession for over 3,000 years. Kingship was passed on to direct descendants only starting with Érimón mac Míl Espáine, 2nd High King of Ireland son of Galamh Milisius.\n\nIn Connacht the first to bear the name was Muireadhach ua Flaithbheartach, king of Maigh Seóla, who died in 1034. He is listed as having three sons – Ruaidhrí of Lough Cimbe, Donagh Aluinn and Aedh. From Ruaidhrí and Donagh would descend the O'Flahertys of East and West Connemara.\n\nIn the Annals of the Four Masters, Rúaidhri Ua Flaithbheartaigh, King of Iar Connacht, is described as dying at the battle of Glen Patrick in 1061 (Book of Ballymote: died 1062). The Annals state:\n\n\nThe following year records that Tadhg, son of Aedh Ua Conchobhair (O'Connor), was \"slain by the son of Aedh, son of Ruaidhri (ie O'Flahertys), and the people of Iar Connacht.\" From this point on, the family were forced into Iar Connacht, as the Kings of Connacht took the original Ua Flaithbheartaigh homeland for themselves.\n\nAedh Ua Flaithbheartaigh, (King of Iar Connacht, died 1079) was the third bearer of the surname Ua Flaithbheartaigh to rule over the Muintir Murchada. Aedh was killed in 1079 by Ruaidrí na Saide Buide (Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, anglicised Roderic O'Connor, died 1118), who in turn was blinded by Flaithbertaigh Ua Flaithbertaigh (Flaherty O'Flaherty), King of Iar Connacht, in 1092.\n\nCrichaireacht cinedach nduchasa Muintiri Murchada is a tract listing the main families and their estates of the Muintir Murchada in the reign of its lord, Flaithbertaigh Ua Flaithbertaigh, who was king of Iar Connacht from 1091 until his death in 1098. He seized the kingship of Connacht in 1092 by blinding the Godfather of his children, King Ruaidrí na Saide Buide. He was killed by Ruaidrí's sons in 1098.\n\nThe subsequent king of Iar Connacht, Muireadhach Ua Flaithbheartaigh (died 1121), and his descendants, remained loyal to the Ó Conchobair's.\n\nBefore the close of the 13th century, the Ó Flaithbertaigh clan became masters of the entire territory of Iar Connacht, extending from the western banks of Lough Corrib to the shores of the Atlantic. In the 1230s, the Normans invaded Ireland and took Galway. Native Irish were forbidden from entering the city freely. In the 16th century, the Ó Flaithbertaigh built a tower house called Aughnanure Castle, which was featured on an Irish stamp and is now a National Monument and tourist destination, managed by the Office of Public Works.\n\nThe clan motto is \"Fortuna Favet Fortibus\", or \"Fortune Favours the Brave\" which may have been inspired by the same line in Virgil's Aeneid. The Ó Flaithbertaigh coat of arms depicts \"two red lizards or dragons rampant combatant, supporting a red dexter hand, couped at the wrists, in base a black boat with eight oars\". The two red lizards or dragons are often confused with the lions of the English heraldic tradition. Often a grey or green salamander is depicted on a black or grey helmet above the coat of arms.\n\nHowever, there is little known of Irish heraldic tradition as compared to that of the English although Irish use of distinctive flags and banners in battle is recorded in Irish annals such as the \"Annals of the Four Masters\".\n\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Western Province, Zambia\n\nWestern Province encompasses the area formerly known as Barotseland in the colonial era.\n\nThe geography of the province is dominated by the Barotse Floodplain of the Zambezi river, extending from the confluence of the Zambezi with the Lungwebungu and Kabompo Rivers at the northern border of the province, to a point below Senanga and above the Ngonye Falls in the south. This floodplain is inundated from December to June, and is fed by other rivers with their own floodplains, and serves as a vast reservoir storing the waters of the Zambezi. The seasonal flooding is very important to agriculture in the province, providing natural irrigation for the grasslands on which huge herds of cattle depend, and bringing water to the settlements along the edges of the plain. Away from the Zambezi and its tributaries, much of the landscape is a gently undulating series of fossil sand dunes from a previous extension of the Kalahari Desert, with numerous lagoons, pans and seasonal swamps in hollows between the dunes. Dry grassland plains, teak forest, miombo woodlands and patches of evergreen Cryptosepalum forest cover the land.\nMongu is now well supplied with paved roads and drainage . The main one and the chief access for the province is the 610-kilometre Lusaka-Mongu road or Great West Road, which in the past has been poorly maintained and is still in a very bad condition, mainly between Kaoma and Mumbwa.\n\nThere is an ambitious regional plan to provide the first ever major link between the road networks of Zambia and Angola via a Barotse Floodplain causeway from Mongu to Kalabo with a bridge over the Zambezi, replacing the current dry-season ferry at Sandaula. A paved highway would then be built north-west to the Angolan border continuing to Lumbala N'guimbo and Cuito Cuanavale. Although the causeway and bridge from the Mongu Kalobo Road has since been completed by the PF Government. In November 2007 unpaved earth causeways were in place from Mongu to beyond Lealui and Sandaula to Kalabo, but bridge construction had not commenced.\n\nThe tarred road from Mongu to Sesheke (M10 Road) is in excellent condition crossing the Zambezi at Sioma. It has become in recent times very busy by copper trucks from Northwestern Province. The only other paved road, Livingstone in Southern Province to Sesheke and the Katima Mulilo Bridge is in acceptable condition from Livingstone to Kazungula and in very bad shape from Kazungula to Sesheke (Katima Mulilo).\n\nThe other roads in the province vary from a few good dry-season gravel roads such as Kaoma to Lukulu, to sandy or muddy tracks passable only by trucks and four-wheel drive vehicles.\n\nAs per the 2010 Zambian census, Western Province had a population of 902,974 accounting to 6.72% of the total Zambian population of 1,3,092,666. There were 433,505 males and 469,469 females, making the sex ratio to 1,083 for every 1,000 males, compared to the national average of 1,028. The literacy rate stood at 61.60% against a national average of 70.2%. The rural population constituted 86.73%, while the urban population was 13.27%. The total area of the province was 126,386 sq. km and the population density was 7.10 per sq. km. The population density during 2000 Zambian census stood at 7.10.

The total population in the province with the condition stood at 1,747. The life expectancy at birth stood at 53 compared to the national average of 51.\n\nThe Lozi are the major ethnic group in the province. The Lozi are traditionally cattle-keepers. They are a collection of 24 subgroups, with a well-established system of traditional rulers headed by the Litunga. The Litunga is assisted by subchiefs in Sesheke Senanga and Kalabo. The seasonal migrations of the Litunga and his court from the dry-season capital of Lealui, on the Zambezi flood-plain, to Limulunga, is an important cultural and now tourist event called the Kuomboka. There is an ethnic Nkoya minority centered on Kaoma (previously called Mankoya) district with their own chieftainship. The main traditional leaders of the Nkoya are Mwene (Chief) Mutondo and his equal counterpart, Mwene (Chief) Kahare all of Kaoma District and the surrounding areas.

In 2016 he coached his home country Puerto Rico at the Olympics in Rio. Currently he is the head coach for Pitchfork Aquatics and Puerto Rico.\n\nHis father is Francisco Canales Roman, from Toa Baja, Puerto Rico, and his mother is Carmen Alvarez Canales, from Mexico City D.F. Fernando has two brothers (swimmer Francisco—Harvard '78 and Stanford '82; Harry Noel—Michigan '87) and one sister (Sandra Lee—CMU '88 & Grand Valley State '89). He graduated from Colegio San Ignacio de Loyola (San Juan) in 1977 and was honored for civic service and athletic achievements with the symbolic key to the City of Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, in 1978.\n\nHe graduated in 1982 with a Bachelor of Science in physiology of exercise and a Bachelor of Arts in history and English from the University of Michigan. After his graduation he worked with legendary Olympic coaches Jon Urbanchek and Dick Kimball from 1982 to 1987 and helped the Wolverines reclaim the Big Ten Championship Title after a 24-year drought in March 1986. Canales was the head swimming and water polo coach at the University of California, Santa Cruz from 1990 to 1992, where he also taught classes within the Physical Education Department.\n\nHe became a national swimming champion at an early age by becoming the top-ranked 17 and under, 100 meter freestyler in the US in 1977 while training under Coach Brad Glenn in Huntsville, Alabama. Canales was ranked 25th in the world that very same year in the 100 Free. His triumphs brought him to the University of Michigan from 1977 to 1982. He excelled at the national and international level by winning All-America Awards in each of his four years of competition. He earned a total of 13 Big Ten Championship titles. Canales was the first swimmer in Big Ten Conference history to capture an individual title (100 yard freestyle) during his four years of competition while training under Head Olympic Coach Gus Stager and 1964 US Olympian Bill Farley.\n\nCanales was a 100-meter freestyle finalist in the 1978 World Championships in West Berlin, Germany, earning a 5th place. He was the \"first\" Puerto Rican swimmer to final in the world championships along with Jesse \"Cheyenne\" Vassallo. He earned five gold medals and one silver medal during the 1978 Central American and Caribbean Games in Medellín, Colombia. He became the first Puerto Rican to win an individual medal in the Pan American Games by winning silver in the 100 meters free in 1979 (San Juan, Puerto Rico) and repeating that feat in 1983 (Caracas, Venezuela). He also won a bronze medal in the 4 x 100 meters medley relay in 1979.\n\nFernando became a national champion while representing Club Wolverine in 1986, when he won the 4 x 100 meter free relay alongside three other Wolverines, Joe Parker, Greg Varner and Dave Kerska. This was the fastest Club Relay in the World for that year. He won the 100 meter free gold medal during the Soviet Spartakiade National Championships in 1979.

He was honored as the flag bearer for the Puerto Rican Olympic Team during the 1984 Summer Olympics Opening and Closing Ceremonies in Los Angeles, 1984. Canales, a 13-time Big Ten Champion and 4 year All-America at Michigan, is featured in the book \"Paths to the Olympics – Maize and Blue to Olympic Gold\" by Marc Parrish, Colemar Press 1997.\n\nHe attributes his triumphs to the support of his mother, brothers and sister, the memory of his father, John Daly's tutelage, his teammates, and the wonderful coaches that helped him during his career: Kika, Julia, Mr. Tom Forte, Carlos Sala, Brad Glenn, Gus Stager, Bill Farley, Dick Kimball, Maggie Shook, Bob Bowman, Mona Nyheim and Jon Urbanchek. All of these coaches shared one thing in common: they participated in the Olympics or the Pan American Games, thus instilling the Olympic dream and the desire to rise above the rest of the competition from an early age.\n\nCanales was inducted into the Puerto Rico Sports Hall of Fame with the class of 1993, which also included internationally famous sports personalities: Orlando \"Peruchin\" Cepeda, Carlos \"Charlie\" Passarell, Raymond Dalmau, Amado Morales and Osvaldo Gil.

The album was reissued February 8, 2005, as a CD+DVD dual disc set. The album is certified Platinum in the US.\n\nFour singles were released from this album. The first, \"Calling All Angels,\" was a top 20 hit on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, peaking at #19, and was a huge success on the Adult Contemporary and Adult Top 40 charts. Second single \"When I Look to the Sky\" also hit the Top 100 and was successful in Adult Top 40 and the Adult Contemporary chart as well. Third single \"Get to Me\" was also a successful song on the Adult Top 40 chart, and the album as a whole has been certified platinum by the RIAA.\n\n\"I'm About to Come Alive\" was covered in 2008 by country music artist David Nail, who released it as a single from his debut album of the same name.\n\n\"My Private Nation\" received mixed reviews from most music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 61, based on 6 reviews, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\". Allmusic editor Thom Jurek praised the band's existential lyrics and producer Brendan O'Brien's contribution to the album, stating \"O'Brien's gorgeous multi-layered production [...] chromatic shadings and the textures of contemporary psychedelia are rooted in the heart of an ambitious garage band [...] he gets the sound of how big Train actually is in a context that is as aurally beautiful musically as it is emotionally and lyrically poignant\". \"Entertainment Weekly\"s Ken Tucker dubbed it Train's \"finest effort yet\", complimenting the band's \"amusingly self-deprecating lyrics\" and the songs' \"surface attractiveness\". Sean Daly of \"The Washington Post\" noted layers of \"featherweight joy\" and \"Hallmark-deep, guitar-driven pop\", and noted lead singer Pat Monahan's performance, \"[he] throws his body into every lyric and sounds like a showoff cross between Live's Ed Kowalczyk and Journey's Steve Perry\". E! Online commented that the band \"sound[s] like a better Counting Crows (with a dreamier frontman) and less-challenging Wallflowers\". Despite writing that \"Pat Monahan's vocals can be a bit grating and Train's material sometimes strays into Black Crowes Lite range\", \"Chicago Sun-Times\" writer Jeff Wisser called the album \"a greatsounding collection of slight but irresistible little poprock confections\", noting \"a sure sense of songcraft and a well-honed pop sensibility\" in the songwriting.\n\n\"Q\" gave the album three out of five stars and stated \"[Train] continues to adhere firmly to the rootsy rock of fellow travellers Matchbox Twenty and Counting Crows, while their earnest musicianship and hard work will delight fans of that sort of thing\". Jeff Puma of \"The Hartford Courant\" commended Train for their \"sincere attempt at a positive message\", but wrote \"The effect, unfortunately, is schmaltz, and Train comes off as a poor man's Counting Crows\". \"Rolling Stone\" writer Gavin Edwards called the band \"radio-ready, professional and utterly dull\", commenting that \"The up-tempo songs are worse than the ballads, and the attempts at lyrical sass are even worse than the sentimental cliches\". Glenn Gamboa of \"Newsday\" found the band's \"sorta rock\" style \"painfully predictable\" on most songs, but stated \"The last three songs - the Oasis-ish 'Your [Every] Color', the '80s power-ballad throwback 'Lincoln Avenue' and the gorgeous 'I'm About to Come Alive' - finally fulfill the promise hinted at in the previous seven songs and most of the previous two albums, for that matter\". Despite calling them \"still essentially Matchbox Twenty Jr.\", \"Los Angeles Times\" writer Steve Hochman commented that the band \"expands its menu beyond vanilla, with some playfulness in words and music, and producer Brendan O'Brien helping bring some imagination to the arrangements\".\n\n\nAlbum\n\nSingle\n\n\n",

Its headquarters is located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\nThe CSV's origins are still under dispute. Some argue it was founded in Buenos Aires, Argentina on February 12, 1946; some, that it was founded in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on July 3 of the same year. Either way, it was formed even before the FIVB itself, and stands as the oldest of all volleyball continental confederations.\n\nUp to now (2004), the CSV has had a total of eight presidents, all but one from national federations with some volleyball tradition at a certain point in history: Brazil, Peru, Argentina, Venezuela and Colombia, which is the exception. Following the election of the current president, Brazilian Mr. Ary Graça Filho, in 2003 the headquarters were relocated from Lima, Peru to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\nThe CSV presides over national volleyball federations located in South America and organizes continental competitions such as the South American Men's Volleyball Championship (first edition, 1951) and the Pan American Games, sometimes in conjunction with the FIVB and with other confederations, notably NORCECA with whom CSV co-organises the Pan-American tournaments. It also takes part in the organization of qualification tournaments for major events such as the Olympic Games or the men's and women's World Championships, and of international competitions hosted by one of its affiliated federations.\n\nLately, the only national South American federation with expressive results in international competitions is Brazil, which maintains intensive development programs for men's and women's volleyball. \nArgentina has some tradition in men's volleyball, but it has shown unmistakable signs of decline: in recent years, Venezuela has been constantly threatening to take its long held position as the second volleyball force of the continent. However, Argentina is still one of the dominant forces in Men's volleyball.\n\nWith a silver medal at the Seoul Olympic Games, Peru had a very strong women's volleyball team in the 1980s. Its level of play has nevertheless dropped after the retirement of superstar players like Cecilia Tait, Natalia Málaga, Rosa García and Gabriela Pérez del Solar. Nevertheless, Peru is still a respectively good team, and one of the main forces of the continent.\n\nIn recent years, the Junior and Youth categories in both boys and girls categories have started to shine in the CSV; as with their senior teams, Brazil in one of the world main forces in Junior and Youth categories but Argentina and Peru have started to shine in the Boys and Girls category respectively; after the I Youth Olympic Games where Argentinean boys got silver and Peruvian girls took bronze, Argentina claimed the top spot and Peru the third spot at the FIVB World Rankings.\n\nAs of 2004, the following national federations were affiliated to the CSV:\n\nMale\n\n\nFemale\n\n\nMale\n\n\nFemale\n\n\n\n",

He was born in Oslo.\n\nSchau is known from several radio shows (most of them also with his brother Alexander Schau) including \"XL\", \"Karate\", and \"Et Norge I Krig\". On TV he has been involved in the shows \"XLTV\", \"Team Antonsen\" (2004), and \"De 7 dødssyndene\" (2007). He has also been part of several bands, among them Gartnerlosjen, Hurra Torpedo, Kåper Gjete, Sinsen, Reidar Roses Orkester, Datsun, The Cumshots and Mongo Ninja. He is also the writer of the Norwegian underground comic \"Margarin\" which is now discontinued. He has created the television shows \"Dag\" and \"One Night\" with his friend Øystein Karlsen.\n\nIn 2007, Schau launched his television show, \"De 7 dødssyndene\", focusing on the seven deadly sins. In the show, Schau attempted to commit all the deadly sins, combined with Schau and his co-hosts, Øystein Karlsen and Morten Ståle Nilsen, presenting information on the history of sin and related subjects. Many Norwegian conservative Christians protested against the program. They organized a petition and a boycott against the show's corporate sponsors, leading to several companies dropping their advertisements. This did not decrease the show's popularity.\n\nOne of his projects had him living in a brown Opel Rekord automobile for a whole week. This event was also televised in daily segments. Another one of his projects was \"\"Forfall\"\" (en. \"decline\"), where Schau devoted an entire week to living as unhealthily as possible. Originally the idea was to deteriorate both physically and mentally, but despite the initial intentions in the mental area (reading books by Norwegian pulp fiction authors), the project mainly focused on eating unhealthy foods and smoking. He spent the entire week on display in an Oslo shop window. The project was also shown on TV and streamed on the internet for the entire week. He gained about 10 kg (22 lbs) and his cholesterol level skyrocketed during the project. He also nearly suffered a heatstroke when the temperature in the shop window display was significantly increased. The heat experiment was then aborted.\n\nDuring the 2004 Quartfestival, a couple, who were both members of Fuck for Forest, had sex on stage during a concert with The Cumshots, a band fronted by Schau. This led to a lawsuit against Schau, the other band members and the couple who performed the sex stunt. Schau and his bandmate Ole Petter Andreassen were both fined 10 000 NOK for their roles in the stunt.\n",

    "text": "Exi (subculture)\n\nThe Exis (pronounced \"Exies\") were a youth movement in Hamburg, Germany, in the 1950s. The Exis took their name from the existentialist movement, and were influenced by its chief proponents, Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. There are similar German nicknames for other movements, such as \"Sozis\" (Socialists) and the \"Nazis\" (National Socialists).\n\nQuite a few of the Hamburg fans of The Beatles, in the period 1960–62, regarded themselves as \"Exis\". In some ways, the Exis were the spiritual successors of the Swing Kids of the 1930s. Both movements were heavily influenced by the prevailing popular culture and music of the United States, whether 1930s Jazz, in the case of the Swing Kids or 1950s Rock and Roll, in the case of the Exis.\n\nAside from the utterly transformed political and cultural atmosphere in Germany after the war, the biggest difference between the two movements was that, where the Swing Kids wholeheartedly embraced American culture (right down to zoot suits and bobby socks), Exis generally wanted to show that they could think for themselves, as many young people do.\n\nOne of the factors, which had strengthened the link between British musical acts and the Hamburg clubs, was the presence of large numbers of British servicemen (see British Army of the Rhine), in the north-west of Germany. In the aftermath of the Second World War, it became common practice for music promoters in north Western Germany, a number of whom were British themselves, to book British acts. However, some parts of Hamburg were off limits to soldiers and airmen and they never seem to have had the influence, which one might have expected, in the post-war development of St Pauli. This was partly because of the changing political and legal position. After 1955, they were \"guests\" on the territory of an ally and NATO member. Before the establishment of the Federal Republic of Germany (i.e. West Germany) in 1949, the British forces had actually governed their sector.\n\nIn any case, the St Pauli district was a place for sailors to relax and artisans to experiment with new ideas, long before the Reeperbahn became internationally famous. In addition, \"Hamburgers\" have always had some sense of being different from other Germans and the area around the Grosse Freiheit, originally just outside the city boundary, was where people were allowed to \"do their own thing\", in various ways (but primarily when it came to religion), as far back as the Eighteenth Century.\n\nWhile the fashion choices of some Exis had a slightly preppy or conservative quality (and, given the middle-class background of most of them, this was probably unavoidable), many sought to distance themselves from the blue-jeaned, check-shirted excesses of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's America, by projecting a somewhat darker and more introspective image. Sartre's black polo-neck sweaters and Gauloises cigarettes were the most obvious symbols. In an interview with NPR, Astrid Kirchherr described the Exy style in Hamburg as consisting of black clothes and very long scarves trailing to the floor. \n\nHowever some American icons of the time, such as James Dean and Marlon Brando, were, in the eyes of most middle-aged Americans of the 1950s, young rebels, rather than suitable role models for the nation's youth. Thus, they were bound to be more attractive to those adolescents, who were trying to stand out from the rest of society, than the \"respectable\" performers, whom parents admired.\n\nThe dress of British and American rockers and bikers, the vast majority of whom had not been anywhere near Hamburg, was not vastly different from some of the Exis but to obsessive teenagers, an extra zip, here and there, can be everything and such comparisons may well have been dismissed by Exis (or Rockers), at the time. There are also similarities to jazz musicians and some of their fans but the Exis did not listen exclusively to Rock and Roll, that unruly mix of Country and Western and Rhythm and Blues.\n",

    "text": "The Second Nun's Tale\n\n\"The Second Nun's Tale\" (Middle English: \"Þe Seconde Nonnes Tale\"), written in late Middle English, is part of Geoffrey Chaucer's \"The Canterbury Tales\", which was a collection of 24 stories narrated by a range of characters on a journey to Canterbury Cathedral. Told by a nun who remains unnamed, \"The Second Nun's Tale\" is a hagiography (saint's life) of the life of Saint Cecilia.\n\nThe lack of portrait description for the second nun in the General Prologue of \"The Canterbury Tales\" has led some scholars to speculate that the tale is merely the second tale of the single nun or of the Prioress but this idea is not widely held. Its relationship to the subsequent Canon's Yeoman's tale is to offer a serious and worthy religious-themed story before a much more irreverent tale of contemporary religious behaviour about foolish alchemists.\n\nAlthough it is unconfirmed what order Geoffrey Chaucer intended The Canterbury Tales, and therefore where \"The Second Nun's Tale\" would place, the main scholarly consensus has placed \"The Second Nun's Tale\" in Fragment VIII (Group G) out of X of the Canterbury Tales.\n\nIn all of the extant manuscripts, The Second Nun's Tale always occurs with The Canon's Yeoman's Tale, further indicating the two tales are to be regarded as a pair.\n\nThe Second Nun's Tales was likely written for another occasion and only later inserted into The Canterbury Tales. In line VIII.62 of the Second Nun's Prologue, the Second Nun refers to herself as an \"unworthy sone of Eve\", indicating the tale previously has a male narrator. In addition, the attribution of the tale to the Second Nun only occurs in the rubrics of the manuscripts, not in the Prologue or Tale itself.\n\n\nThe Prologue of The Second Nun's Tale contains three sections: 1. four stanzas on the hazards of idleness, 2. the Invocation to Mary (nine stanzas), and 3. the \"Interpretation of the name Cecilia which Brother Jacob of Genoa put in his legend\". This final section comprises a series of invented etymologies about that name Cecilia. \"It is a good example of a medieval method of interpretation that adds rather than discovers meaning; it aims not for one but for a variety of interpretations, all of which are right and none which excludes the others, so that the object of interpretation, here the name Cecilia, gains in richness of meaning and range of reference.\"\n\nThe Invocation to Mary (Invocacio ad Mariam) is a nine paragraph portion of the prologue, telling of the origin of the name of Cecilia. The Invocation has been argued to draw from many other sources in terms of its composure,: first of all Dante, but also many medieval liturgical hymns.\n\nA virgin maiden, Cecilia, is to be wedded to a man Valerian. Cecilia asks Valerian to swear not to betray her if she tells her secret, that she has an angel that watches over her, with Christianity being a crime at the time. From there Valerian is sceptical and Cecilia asks him to embark on a journey to see Saint Urban, who would \"purge\" Valerian of sin and let him see the angel. Valerian then found Urban who purged him of sin and when Valerian returned he saw Cecilia with an angel. This angel gave Valerian a single wish, of which Valerian answered to give his brother, Tiburce, the same gift he was given, of the truth of Christ. Tiberuce appeared and then accepted the word of Christ. Valerian then took Tiburce to Urban, who had been condemned to die by the state, and Christened Tiberuce.\n\nAlmachius, the prefect, later seizes the martyrs and orders them to abandon their faith or be sentenced to death; However, the executioners were converted to Christianity. Both Tiburce and Valerian still come forward for the execution as a show of faith, and as their heads fall their spirits rise up to heaven converting even more spectators. Eventually, Almachius orders his men to capture Cecilia, which they do successfully, and they bring her to him during which she boldly spites him with religiously charged words and champions her faith. Almachius orders her execution by a boiling bath; however, due to her faith Cecilia sits safely in the bath. Almachius then orders the executioner to strike three blows on her – but her head does not fall off. Eventually, three days later, after preaching even in her partially decapitated state, she ascends to heaven and Saint Urban buries her body among other saints.\n\nThe Second Nun's Tale explains the story of a young noble lady named Cecilia, and how her unwavering faith in God transformed her into Saint Cecilia.\n\nA young maiden named Cecilia, from \"her cradle onward,\" was highly devoted to her faith in Christ, and her love for Virgin Mary, so she asked God to protect her virginity. Even when she was betrothed to a man named Valerian, on her wedding day she begged God again to protect her virginity and sang to him, \"O Lord, keep my soul and my body unspotted, lest I be confounded.\" On her wedding night, Cecilia asked Valerian to understand her decision to not consummate the marriage, and informed him that her body is protected by an angel of God, and if he was to touch or love her \"ignobly,\" the angel would \"without delay...slay you on the spot\". However, if he protects Cecilia \"in clean love\", the angel would also love him and appreciate him for his purity. When Valerian asked to see the angel, Cecilia told him that he must \"go forth to the Appian Way,\" and get baptised by Saint Urban.\n\nAfter his baptism, during which he saw God who appeared as an old man in pure white garments, Valerian returned home and saw the angel. The angel gifted him and Cecilia with two crowns of lilies and roses, and asked that they guard the crowns with \"a pure body and unspotted thought.\" The lilies and roses from the crown were fetched by the angel from \"Paradise\". Valerian then asked his brother, Tiburce, to come and accept God and know the truth, so he could also be protected by the angel. The angel then agreed and called his brother to come.\n\nUpon his arrival, Valerian convinced Tiburce to get baptised by Pope Urban, and renounce his faith in idols. Cecilia referred to them as, \"nothing but vain things, for they are dumb and deaf…\" Tiburce went with his brother to Pope Urban, and got christened, which allowed him also to see the angel of God.\n\nEventually, Almachius the prefect heard of this and ordered his officers to take these saints to the idol of Jupiter, and to behead anyone who does not make a sacrifice. On his way, Maximus, one of his officers, started crying and per the saints' instructions, he took the executioners to his house and from their preaching, \"...they rooted out the false faith from the executioners,\" and made them believers of God. Cecilia baptised them all together, and told Valerian and Tiburce that they had served well, and preserved their faith, and in order to save their lives, they should do the sacrifice. However, Valerian and Tiburce did not care for this, and in their unwavering devotion, fell to their knees, ready to lose their heads. When Maximus saw this, he told many others, in turn converting many of them, and also losing his life to his oppressor, Almachius.\n\nAfter Cecilia buried the three of them, Almachius sent for some of his men to seize her and have her taken to Jupiter to make a sacrifice, who were also converted by her preaching. After hearing this, Almachius ordered her to be brought before him, and in a trial, questioned her about her faith. Cecilia told him that she did not fear his power, and that she would neither make a sacrifice nor renounce her faith in Christianity. Cecilia greeted a man with such power as a \"foolish creature\". She stated that Almachius \"in all things an ignorant officer and a vain judge\". Enraged by her boldness and steadfast faith, Almachius commanded his men to bring her to the bathhouse and \"burn her right in a bath of red flames.\"\n\nShe laid in the bath for the day and night however her body, representative of her unwavering faith, remained unharmed that \"she sat cold and felt no pain; it did not make her sweat even a drop\". So Almachius sent for one of his men to slay her and kill her. The executioner struck her thrice in her neck, and no more because it was against the law, yet she still did not die. Cecilia stayed like that, half-dead, with her neck cut open for three days, preaching and converting those who gathered around her. She finally died after the third day, and after she died, Pope Urban buried her body with the other saints and decreed her as Saint Cecilia.\n\nThroughout the story, the importance of chastity is first to Saint Cecilia.\n\nDaily, Cecilia prayed that God would \"protect her virginity\". She then tells her husband, Valerian, that if he were to \"touch or love [her] ignobly, without delay [the angel] will slay you on the spot; and thus [he] would die in [his] youth\".He hears this and he respects her wishes. Almachius, a Roman prefect, does not.\n\nAfter learning that she is practising Christianity and of her boldness, he orders her to be burnt. Although she sat in a bath of flames, she sat there untouched by any of them. She sat cold and did not sweat one drop. After realising his failure, he then used his \"evil mind\" to devise that she be beheaded. She was then sent to be executed by three strokes to the neck. After three strokes, her head was still attached and the executioner could not hit her again. Even with this occurrence, Saint Cecilia still tells the Gospel to anyone that will hear her.\n\nDespite the physical torture that Cecilia's body endures through the beating, burning, and slashing of her throat, she still remains alive for three days, and is able to convert many non-believers through her preachings. Her body supports her, and does not fail her when she needs it the most. Cecilia's body is a symbol for her unwavering faith, and devotion. It refuses to give in to the pain inflicted by her oppressor, Almachius, just like how Cecilia refuses to give in to his psychological tortures. \nCecilia's body's ability to maintain its chastity can also be seen as noteworthy. Despite having been forced into marriage to Valerian, and being punished for her chastity by Almachius, she was still able to preserve her chastity until she died. During this time, the female body was seen as one of the major sources where evil was birthed from. In \"Body Symbolism in the Book of Margery Kempe\", Susan Morgan states that, \"medieval theologians and hagiographers viewed female sin as intrinsically bodily and sexual, emanating from within.\" By keeping her virginity intact, Cecilia's body was able to evade this \"sin\" which ultimately helped her maintain her devotion, and led to her being a saint.\n\nAccording to \"Body and Soul Dialogues in the Seventeenth Century\", \"the body may commit sinful actions, but the guilt is really the soul's\". In the case of Cecilia, she controlled her body through her soul. She did not let the ways of the world affect her soul, therefore her body remained unharmed. \"Body and Soul\" goes on to state that the soul was \"created good and noble\". The \"world and the devil\" impacted the flesh, yet the soul can take control and urge the body not to sin. This is what Saint Cecilia does through her faith. \"Body without soul does nothing\" meaning that her soul and faith are so strong, her body must and will follow her willingly.\n\nCecilia's ability to maintain control over her body can be explained by her tendency to fast. Cecilia prayed to God to protect her virginity, and \"for the love of Him who died upon a tree she fasted every second or third day.\" By many, fasting was seen as a way to maintain control over one's body. Susan Morgan states that, \"[t]he link between eating and sexual domination has a long history in Christian tradition\" and \"[w]hen women…fasted…they were…punishing and disciplining their flesh in pursuit of the higher goal of asexuality or chastity.\" Similarly, Cecilia's decision to fast helped her control her body and remain chaste and pure. Additionally, Morgan states that, \"food asceticism\" helps one \"journey into the body, conjoining the humanity of Christ…\" Therefore, fasting not only helps Cecilia exhibit control over her body, but it also helped her feel closer to God and his power. As a woman, she holds exponential power when it comes to her religion. According to \"Woman and the Church\", \"all through the history of the church women have played a great part\". It goes on to say \"Our Lady in the beginning had, and still holds, a most exalted position\".\n\nRemaining chaste and being in control of their own bodies, can also help women feel powerful. Cathy Hampton states that, '[a]ll virtuous women must accede directly to the call to chastity, an imperative that places them on equal footing rather than in a relationship of hierarchy.\" Relating to Cecilia, her decision to keep her virginity intact throughout her life may have also helped her feel more powerful, and made her realise that she had the independence to control her life allowing her to battle the oppression of Almachius.\n\nAn angel gives two crowns both to Valerian and Cecilia in \"The Second Nun's Tale\", which is symbolic in its nature. The crowns are composed of roses and lilies, which are allegorical references to martyrdom and virginity. These crowns were given to Valerian and Cecilia after the angel told them to \"always guard these crowns well, with pure body and unspotted thought\". By referencing virginity through the flowers the angel fetched from \"Paradise\", the crowns are now a symbolic representation of their purity through God and from God.\n\nIn the Second Nun's Tale, Geoffrey Chaucer's characters' senses of sight, smell, and touch allows them to perceive the divine nature of things and gain a deeper spiritual understanding, which helped some of them ultimately reach martyrdom.\n\nSight: When Valerian asks Cecilia to see the angel, she says, \"That angel you shall see… so long you believe in Christ and are baptized.\" Tiburce, also, only sees the angel after he gets baptised by Saint Urban. Elizabeth Robertson states that, \"Chaucer validates the body's ability to apprehend the meaning of Christianity through senses.\" Overcoming their limited sight and seeing the angel, parallels to them gaining a deeper understanding of Christianity and religion.\n\nAccording to \"Truth and Sight: Generalizing without Universalizing\", \"with the type of psychology that the awareness of deceit creates, the idea that what is seen is more truthful than what is reported in speech seems an obvious way in order to bypass human...deceit\".\n\nSmell: Tiburce was immediately able to smell the sweet odour of the crowns of lilies and roses, even if he could not see them. These crowns are symbolic of the divine and his brother's and Cecilia's faith in God, and they lure Tiburce to seek this divinity and become a believer. Robertson confirms this by saying, \"the flowers create in Tiburce a desire to know more about the spiritual truth, a desire that leads him to affirm his belief in God.\"\n\nTouch: Valerian is unable to touch Cecilia's body, because the angel of God will kill him, so long as he is still a non-believer. Later, Cecilia tells Almachius to go beyond the materialised idols, and touch what he cannot see. However, Almachius is unable to do so, thus preventing him from gaining deeper spiritual understanding and belief.\n\n\n",

    "text": "University of Zambia\n\nThe University of Zambia (UNZA) is a public university located in Lusaka, Zambia. It is Zambia's largest learning institution. The university was established in 1965 and officially opened to the public on 12 July 1966. It is the oldest public university in Zambia. The language of instruction is English.\n\nThe beginnings of UNZA can be traced back to before the Second World War when the idea to establish a University in Northern Rhodesia was conceived. However, plans were halted when the war broke out and only revived after. The colonial government instituted plans to set up a Central African University College, for Africa, due to the development of higher education institutions in most parts of Africa.\n\nThe Central Africa council (CAC) appointed a committee to investigate requirements for a college for higher education and, it subsequently recommended that a college for higher education be established. A subsequent investigation into the need for higher education for Africans in Central Africa was conducted by Sir Alexander Carr-Saunders in 1952, with a follow up report submitted in March 1953. The Southern Rhodesia Government accepted the establishment of a multi-racial University College and the commission consequently recommended that an institution be established in Salisbury. However, a minority report written by Alexander Kerr, provided a counter argument suggesting that the establishment of a higher education institution on the basis of equality between races was not feasible and thus recommended that a university for non-Europeans be established in Lusaka.\n\nThe political climate, as a result of the independence struggle, in the late 1950s and early 1960s made the idea of an all-inclusive University College of Rhodesia less attractive. As a result, plans to solicit support for the establishment of a higher education institution in Lusaka were initiated. In March 1963, the new Northern Rhodesia Government appointed a commission, the Lockwood Commission, led by Sir John Lockwood to assess the feasibility of setting up a university for Northern Rhodesia. The commission placed a lot of emphasis on autonomy and thus recommended the establishment of a university with no ties with already established universities in Britain. The report also recommended the establishment of the University of Zambia as a full-fledged university from the onset.\n\nA Provisional Council of the University of Zambia was put in place after enactment of the University of Zambia Act, 1965. In July 1965, Douglas G. Anglin was appointed Vice Chancellor and, in October 1965, President Kenneth David Kaunda gave the assent of Act no 66 of the 1965 act. \n\nThe University of Zambia was inaugurated on 13 July 1966 following the appointment of President Kenneth David Kaunda as the first Chancellor on 12 July 1966.\n\nIts main campus, the Great East Road Campus, is along the Great East Road, about 7 km from the CBD. It also has the Ridgeway Campus also located within Lusaka City at the University Teaching Hospital; this campus houses students pursuing medical and pharmacological courses.\n\nThe University of Zambia has over 157 degree and postgraduate degree programmes. The University of Zambia is divided into the following faculties:\n\nSchool of Agricultural Sciences\n\n\nSchool of Engineering\n\n\nSchool of Education\n\n\nSchool of Humanities and Social Sciences\n\n\nSchool of Law\n\n\nSchool of Mines\n\n\nSchool of Medicine\n\n\nSchool of Natural Sciences\n\n\nSchool of Veterinary Medicine\n\n\nGraduate School of Business\n\n\nUNZA is a member of the Association of African Universities, the Association of Commonwealth Universities, and the International Association of Universities.\n\n",

    "text": "Henri de Latouche\n\nHyacinthe-Joseph Alexandre Thabaud de Latouche, commonly known as Henri de Latouche (2 February 1785 – 9 March 1851) was a French poet and novelist known for his publication of André Chénier and early encouragement of George Sand. (His family name is also seen as \"Thabaud de La Touche\" and even sometimes \"Delatouche\".)\n\nHe was born at La Châtre (Indre).\n\nAmong his works may be distinguished his comedies: \"Projets de sagesse\" (1811), and, in collaboration with Emile Deschamps, \"Selmours de Florian\" (1818), which ran for a hundred nights; also \"La Reine d'Espagne\" (1831), which proved too indecent for the public taste; a novel, \"Fragoletta ou Naples et Paris en 1799\" (1829), which attained a success of notoriety; \"La Vallée aux loups\" (1833), a volume of prose essays and verse; and two volumes of poems, \"Les Adieus\", (1843) and \"Les Agrestes\" (1844).\n\nLatouche's chief claim to remembrance is that he revealed to the world the genius of André Chénier, then only known to a limited few. The remains of the poet's work had passed from the hands of Daunou to Latouche, who had sufficient critical insight instantly to recognize their value. In editing the first selection of Chénier's poems (1819) he made some trifling emendations, but did not, as Beranger afterwards asserted, make radical and unnecessary changes.\n\nLatouche was guilty of more than one literary fraud. He caused a licentious story of his own to be attributed to the duchess of Duras, the irreproachable author of \"Ourika\". He made many enemies by malicious attacks on his contemporaries. The \"Constitutionnel\" was suppressed in 1817 by the government for an obscure political allusion in an article by Latouche. He then undertook the management of the \"Mercure du XIXe siècle\", and began a bitter warfare against the monarchy.\n\nAfter 1830 he edited \"Le Figaro\", and spared neither the liberal politicians nor the romanticists who triumphed under the monarchy of July. In his turn he was violently attacked by Gustave Planche in the \"Revue des deux mondes\" for November 1831. But it must be remembered to the credit of Latouche that he did much to encourage George Sand at the beginning of her career.\n\nThe last twenty years of his life were spent in retirement at Val d’Aulnay.\n\nSainte-Beuve, in the \"Causeries du lundi\", vol. 3, gives a not too sympathetic portrait of Latouche. See also George Sand in the \"Siecle\" for the 18th, 19th and 20 July 1851.\n\n",

    "text": "Panzer Armee Afrika (board game)\n\nPanzer Armee Afrika is a board wargame that was published in 1973 by Simulations Publications, Inc. The game is a simulation of the campaign for North Africa during World War II, from the arrival of Erwin Rommel in April 1941 until November 1942, when the Second Battle of El Alamein took place in reality. The game was designed by Jim Dunnigan, with the system design and graphics by Redmond A. Simonsen and game development by Irad Hardy and Hank Zucker. It was first published in \"Strategy & Tactics\" #40, and later appeared in a boxed edition. It was republished by Avalon Hill in the mid-1980s.\n\nThis game provided a relatively realistic simulation of the actual campaign, with small numbers of units, rapid movements across the map, critical logistic effects, the ebb and flow of the forces, and the strengths and weaknesses of both the Allied and Axis formations.\n\nThis game was published using the compartmented plastic box that was common with many of the wargames produced by Simulations Publications. It included a 22\" × 34\" stiff paper map printed in various shades of brown, a set of die-cut cardboard counters, and the rules. The map is overlaid by a hex grid to standardize movement, with a scale of 12 miles per hex. Each game turn represented one month during the war, and the full campaign lasts 20 turns.\n\nOnly about half the total height of the game board is used for the actual map. The remainder is covered by various charts and tables used in the game. Along the bottom is the game turn track that lists the reinforcements for each side. There is also a chart showing the various effects of the different terrain types, a combat results chart for resolving battles, a summary table of the various supply effects, and tracks for marking replacements for allied and axis forces.\n\nMost of the game map consists of the western desert of Libya and Egypt, and the various roads and tracks that were used for movement and supply. Important features include the array of escarpments near Tobruk, and the Qattara Depression - impassably rugged terrain south of El Alamein and northern Cyrenaica. The hexes containing Tobruk and Bardia are also fortified (the latter less so), aiding in their defense. At the start of the game the entire map is controlled by (thinly-spread) Commonwealth forces, who are deemed to have driven the Italians from Cyrenaica in late 1940, only for many of the Commonwealth forces to be withdrawn to fight in the Greek campaign.\n\nThe counters represent the major formations that took part in the campaign, including German, Italian, and British allied units. Each counter represented a battalion, regiment, or brigade-strength unit. The sheet is printed in different shades of brown for the different forces, with creme for Italy, tan for Germany, and dark brown for Britain and her allies (the latter are red in the Avalon Hill edition). There are also various markers used primarily to manage the supply rules.\n\nEach of the military unit counters is printed with standard markings indicating the unit type, size, designation, and the combat strength and movement allowance. Typical movement allowances were 40, 50, 60, making for a highly fluid and mobile game. The types of units represented are infantry, paratroops, glider infantry, armor, armored infantry, and reconnaissance.\n\nThis is a two player game with one player controlling the allied forces and the other player the axis units. Each turn resolves allied actions first, followed by the axis. A player's turn consists of the supply determination, followed by movement, combat resolution, and the addition of reinforcements and the replacement of previously destroyed units.\n\nThe allied player also has a command control phase before movement, which restricts certain units from moving. Each hex on the map grid has a unique 4-digit number. Based on a random die roll, units on a hex with last numbers matching the three values on the command control chart values are unable to move. Thus, although the allied forces normally enjoy numerical superiority, typically 30% of them are stationary each turn.\n\nMovement across the map is measured in terms of movement points (MP). Roads provide the optimal path for movement, and it only costs 1 MP to advance a hex through a hex side with a road. Track hexes cost 2 MP, open hexes 3 MP, and swamp or rough hexes and escarpment hex sides cost 10 MP. Only three friendly units can end their movement in the same hex.\n\nSupply is a key factor in this game, as it was in the historical campaign. Supply is typically provided by supply units, which are indicated by markers on the map. Each side must have a chain of these markers back to a supply base, with each supply unit within 20 movement points of the next. Supply units can be captured or moved about by each player's truck unit, but both sides normally only receive one such unit. As the truck only has 40 MP and must move back and forth to carry the supply units, this can severely hinder the advance of a supply line. Additional truck units may be generated by immobilising combat units.\n\nIn order to be considered in supply, a unit must be within 20 movement points of a supply unit that is part of a supply chain. Unsupplied units are unable to move or attack, and defend at half strength. Supplied units can move and defend normally, and attack at half strength. Units within 8 MP of a supply unit receive a higher level of supply, and can attack at full strength. By expending a supply unit, the combat strength of units within 8 MP is temporarily doubled (\"Maximum Attack Supply\").\n\nThe six hexes surrounding the hex containing a unit on the map form a zone of control over which the unit exerts an influence. Units entering an enemy zone of control must cease their movement for the round. Units already in an enemy zone of control can not directly move to another enemy zone of control. Zones of control also block enemy supply lines.\n\nAttacks can be made against adjacent enemy units. The player selects which units adjacent to the enemy will participate in the attack and adds up their combat strength. The combat strengths of the opponents units in the hex being attacked are also totaled, and the result is subtracted from the attack total. This determines the column on the combat results table to be used to resolve the combat. A six-sided die is rolled to determine the result.\n\nThe outcome of the attack is either no effect (for a low differential and a poor roll) or a number of the defenders strength points lost. The defender must eliminate enough of the units under attack to satisfy the losses, and then perform a counterattack after doubling (or quadrupling for the Germans) the surviving defender's combat strengths.\n\nThe game includes special rules for overruns (attacks performed during movement); sea movement; rail movement between Alexandria and Matruh and replacement points to rebuild destroyed units - the Allied player may use such points to augment his units beyond their initial strength. There are also optional game variants to cover the results of the off-map attempt to capture Malta (decided by a single die roll, with extra Axis reinforcements if the attack succeeds, but fewer if it fails) and the arrival of additional Allied units beyond the historical deployment (e.g. US reinforcements - in reality US forces fought in Tunisia but not in the Desert campaign).\n",

    "text": "Carl Correns\n\nCarl Erich Correns (19 September 1864 – 14 February 1933) was a German botanist and geneticist, who is notable primarily for his independent discovery of the principles of heredity, which he achieved simultaneously but independently of the botanist Hugo de Vries and for his rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's earlier paper on that subject.\n\nCorrens was a student of Karl Nägeli, a renowned botanist with whom Mendel corresponded about his work with peas, and who subsequently engaged in a long exchange of letters concerning reproducibility of the results in another species (Hieracium). Because of the special properties of Hieracium, those experiments failed and Mendel dropped his studies on the subject.\n\nCarl Correns was born September 1864 in Munich. Orphaned at an early age, he was raised by an aunt in Switzerland. He entered the University of Munich in 1885. While there, he was encouraged to study botany by Karl Nägeli. After completing his thesis, Correns became a tutor at the University of Tübingen and in 1913 he became the first director of the newly founded Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology in Berlin-Dahlem. He married a niece of Karl Nägeli, Elisabeth Widmer.\n\nCarl Correns conducted much of the foundational work for the field of genetics at the turn of the 20th century. He rediscovered and independently verified the work of Mendel in a separate model organism. He also discovered cytoplasmic inheritance, an important extension of Mendel's theories, which demonstrated the existence of extra-chromosomal factors on phenotype. Some of his unpublished work and most of his lab books were destroyed in the Berlin bombings of 1945.\n\nIn 1892, while at the University of Tübingen, Correns began to experiment with trait inheritance in plants. Correns published his first paper on 25 January 1900, which cited both Charles Darwin and Mendel, recognising the relevance of genetics to Darwin's ideas. In Correns' paper, \"G. Mendel's Law Concerning the Behavior of the Progeny of Racial Hybrids\", he restated Mendel's results as the' law of segregation' and introduced a new 'law of independent assortment'.\n\nAfter rediscovering Mendel's laws of heredity, which can be explained with chromosomal inheritance, he undertook experiments with the four o'clock plant Mirabilis jalapa to investigate apparent counterexamples to Mendel's laws in the heredity of variegated (green and white mottled) leaf color. Correns found that, while Mendelian traits behave independently of the sex of the source parent, leaf color depended greatly on which parent had which trait. For instance, pollinating an ovule from a white branch with pollen from another white area resulted in white progeny, the predicted result for a recessive gene. Green pollen used on a green stigma resulted in all green progeny, the expected result for a dominant gene. However, if green pollen fertilized a white stigma, the progeny were white, but if the sexes of the donors were reversed (white pollen on a green stigma), the progeny were green.\n\nThis non-mendelian inheritance pattern was later traced to a gene named \"iojap\" which codes for a small protein required for proper assembly of the chloroplast ribosome. Even though \"iojap\" assorts according to Mendel's rules, if the mother is homozygous recessive, then the protein is not produced, the chloroplast ribosomes fail to form, and the plasmid becomes non-functional because the ribosomes cannot be imported into the organelle. The progeny could have functional copies of \"iojap\", but since the chloroplasts come exclusively from the mother in most angiosperms, they would have been inactivated in the previous generation, and so will give white plants. Conversely, if a white father is paired with a green mother with functional chloroplasts, the progeny will only inherit functional chloroplasts, and will thus be green. In his 1909 paper, he established variegated leaf color as the first conclusive example of cytoplasmic inheritance.\n\n",

    "text": "Archbishopric of Ohrid\n\nThe Archbishopric of Ohrid, also known as the Bulgarian Archbishopric of Ohrid (, ), originally called Archbishopric of Justiniana Prima and all Bulgaria (), was an autonomous Orthodox Church under the tutelage of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople between 1019 and 1767. It was established following the Byzantine conquest of the First Bulgarian Empire in 1018 by lowering the rank of the autocephalous Bulgarian Patriarchate due to its subjugation to Constantinople.\n\nThe initial title of the archbishopric was simply \"Bulgaria\" (), but under the famous archbishop Theophylact Hephaistos (1078–1107) it was expanded to \"All Bulgaria\" or \"Whole Bulgaria\" (). John IV (1139/42–1163/64), the cousin of Emperor John II Komnenos, was the first to use the title of \"Archbishop of Justiniana Prima and All Bulgaria\" () in 1157, reflecting a recently developed trend that claimed for the see the succession and prerogatives of the short-lived Archbishopric of Justiniana Prima (535 – ), founded by Justinian I. This title apparently fell into disuse by John's immediate successors, possibly due to pressure from the Patriarchate of Constantinople, but in the early 13th century it was revived by the ambitious Demetrios Chomatenos (1216–1236) to support his claims of quasi-patriarchal status in his clash over authority with the patriarchs of Constantinople in exile at the Empire of Nicaea. The designation finally became accepted by Constantinople and the Byzantine imperial chancery after 1261, and a fixed part of the archbishops' titulature; in the fullest form, the see was hence known as the Archbishopric of Justiniana Prima, Ohrid and all Bulgaria ().\n\n\"Archbishopric of Ohrid\" is the most common term of reference for the see because for the duration of its existence, from 1020 to 1767, its seat was in the city of Ohrid.\n\nShortly after 934, the Byzantine emperor Romanos I Lekapenos recognized the head of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, Archbishop Damian, to the rank of patriarch, following the terms of the peace treaty that ended the Byzantine–Bulgarian war of 913–927. In 971, Emperor John I Tzimiskes dismissed Damian after annexing the capital city of Great Preslav and parts of northeast Bulgaria, but the Bulgarian patriarchate was probably restored under Tsar Samuel of Bulgaria. During his rule, the residence of the Bulgarian patriarchs remained closely connected to the developments in the war between Samuel and the Byzantine emperor Basil II. Thus, the next Patriarch German resided consecutively in Moglena (Almopia), Vodena (Edessa) and Prespa. Around 990, the last patriarch, Philip, moved to Ohrid.\n\nFollowing his final subjugation of the Bulgarian state in 1018, Basil II established the Archbishopric of Ohrid by downgrading the Bulgarian patriarchate into an autocephalous church, separate from the Patriarchate of Constantinople; to underscore that fact, its head was selected by the emperor from a list of three candidates submitted by the local church synod. In three \"sigillia\" issued in 1020 Basil II gave extensive privileges to the new see.\n\nAlthough the first appointed archbishop (John of Debar) was a Bulgarian, his successors, as well as the whole higher clergy, were invariably Byzantine, the most famous of them being Saint Theophylact (1078–1107). The Archbishops were chosen from among the monks in Constantinople. Adrianos Komnenos, under his monastic name of John (IV) (1143–1160), was the cousin of Emperor John II Komnenos, and was the first Archbishop who held the title of Archbishop of Justiniana Prima. The later archbishop John V Kamateros (1183–1216) was a former imperial clerk.\n\nIn the 13th and the first half of the 14th centuries, the territory of the Archbishopric was contested by the Byzantine Empire, the Latin Empire, the Despotate of Epirus, the Second Bulgarian Empire and later Serbia. After the fall of Constantinople to the Latins in 1204 and with the foundation of the new states on the territory under jurisdiction of the Ohrid Archbishopric, autonomous churches were founded in the states which did not accept the jurisdiction either of Constantinople or of Ohrid. After 1204, the Empire of Nicaea claimed the Byzantine imperial heritage and provided refuge to the exiled patriarchs of Constantinople. In the restored Second Bulgarian Empire, a new Archbishopric was founded with its see in Tarnovo. Tsar Kaloyan (1197–1207) did not succeed in putting the Ohrid Archbishopric under the jurisdiction of the Tarnovo Archbishopric, but nevertheless managed to expel the Greek bishops and install Bulgarians instead. The next Bulgarian rulers were constantly trying to reunite the Ohrid Archbishopric with the Tarnovo Archbishopric. The Latin conquests, the restoring of the Bulgarian Empire and the formation of independent Serbian state reduced the jurisdiction of the Ohrid Archbishopric immensely, but it did not disappear. During the time of Archbishop Demetrios Chomatenos, the autocephaly of the Archbishopric was confirmed with the act of anointing the despot of Epirus, Theodore Komnenos Doukas, as Emperor and in a correspondence with the Patriarch.\n\nThe southward expansion of the Serbian state in the second half of 13th century was also followed by changes in ecclesiastical jurisdiction of some sees. After the successful Serbian campaigns against Byzantine empire in 1282-1283, cities of Skopje and Debar were annexed and local eparchies transferred to the jurisdiction of Serbian Archbishopric of Peć.\n\nSerbian expansion reached its apogee at the time of king and tsar Stefan Dušan (1331–1355). Dušan had conquered Ohrid around 1334. Under Serbian rule the Archbishopric of Ohrid kept its autonomy. On 16 April 1346 (Easter), at the Serbian capital city of Skopje, a joined state and church assembly (\"sabor\") was held, attended by Serbian Archbishop Joanikije II, the Archbishop Nicholas I of Ohrid, the Patriarch Simeon of Bulgaria and other hierarchs and dignitaries, including monastic leaders of Mount Athos. The assembly proclaimed the raising of the autocephalous Serbian Archbishopric to the rank of Patriarchate. The Archbishopric of Ohrid was not annexed to the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć and kept its autonomy, recognizing only the honorary seniority of the Serbian Patriarch.\n\nAfter the Battle of Maritsa in 1371, and Battle of Kosovo in 1389, much of the territory of the Archbishopric of Ohrid was affected by expansion of Ottoman Turks, who conquered Skopje in 1392 and annexed all southern regions after the death of Prince Marko in 1395. The archbishopric managed to survive the transition and was legalized by new Ottoman authorities. Not long after the fall of the Bulgarian Patriarchate in 1394, some of the bishoprics under its jurisdiction also entered the Ohrid Archbishopric. Thus, in the beginning of the 15th century, the Archbishop of Ohrid, attached the dioceses of Sofia and Vidin to the Archbishopric. In 1408, Ohrid came under Ottoman rule. Still, the Ottomans did not reach after the Ohrid Archbishopric, mostly because of their tolerance for monotheistic religions, and left the people to govern themselves regarding religion.\n\nWhen the last medieval Serbian Patriarch died in 1463, there were no technical options to elect a new one, so the Ohrid Archbishopric had laid its claim over many of the Serbian Patriarchate's eparchies on the basis of its old 1019 territorial rights, predating Serbian autocephaly. By the 1520s, the Archbishopric of Ohrid had managed to put practically the entire Serbian Church under its jurisdiction, however by intervention of Sokollu Mehmed Pasha in 1557, the latter was renewed and reorganized. During the 15th century, dioceses from the other side of the Danube, from the duchies of Wallachia and Moldova, fell under the jurisdiction of the Archbishopric. Nevertheless, this did not last for more than a hundred years. Towards the beginning of the 16th century, the Ohrid Archbishopric expanded its jurisdiction even over territories in Southern Italy, as well as in Dalmatia. The flock of this diocese was made of Greeks and Albanians. Towards the middle of the 16th century, the Ohrid Archbishopric lost the Diocese of Veroia, however, at the beginning of the 17th century, it gained the Diocese of Durazzo from the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Since then and until its abolishment in 1767, the Archbishopric neither lost nor gained a diocese under its jurisdiction.\n\nThe autocephaly of the Ohrid Archbishopric remained respected during the periods of Byzantine, Bulgarian, Serbian and Ottoman rule and the church continued to exist until its abolition in 1767, when it was abolished by the Sultan's decree, at the urging of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, and was placed under the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Constantinople. The division into phanariotes and autochthonists which occurred among the diocesan bishops of the Ohrid Archbishopric and, the difficult financial position of the Ohrid Archbishopric over a longer period of time, contributed to its abolishment. Just a year before, the Patriarchate of Constantinople abolished the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć in the same manner, and its dioceses adjoined to the Patriarchate of Constantinople.\n\nThe Greek language quite early replaced Old Church Slavonic as the official language of the Archbishopric. All documents and even hagiographies of Bulgarian saints, for example the hagiography of Saint Clement of Ohrid, were written in Greek. Despite this, the Slavonic liturgy was preserved on the lower levels of the Church for several centuries.\n\nThe Archbishopric of Ochrid was an autocephalous church, with full internal ecclesiastical self-governance. Only after the Ottoman conquest, as part of the \"millet\" system, did it come under the supreme ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.\n\nAt the time of its establishment, the archbishopric comprised 32 suffragan sees. However, over the following decades many of the bishoprics removed from other jurisdictions and accorded to Ohrid by Basil II were returned to their original metropolises. Despite the creation of new bishoprics from existing ones, by the middle of the 12th century the number of suffragans—apart from Ohrid itself—had decreased to 23 (modern names in parentheses): Kastoria, Skopia (Skopje), Belebousdion (Velbazhd), Sardike or Triaditza (Sofia), Malesobe or Morobisdion (unlocated), Edessa or Moglena, Herakleia (Bitola) or Pelagonia, Prisdiana, Tiberioupolis or Stroummitza (Strumica), Nisos, Kephalenia or Glabinitze, Morabos or Branitzobe, Sigida or Belegrada (Belgrade), Bidine (Vidin), Sirmion (Sremska Mitrovica), Lipenion, Rhasos (Ras), Selasphoros or Diabolis (Devol), Slanitza or Pella, Illyrikon or Kanina, Grebenon (Grevena), Deure, and the bishopric of the Vlachs.\n\n\n",

Bell\n\nWilliam Joseph Bell (March 6, 1927 – April 29, 2005) was an American screenwriter and television producer, best known as the creator of the soap operas \"Another World\", \"The Young and the Restless\" and \"The Bold and the Beautiful\".\n\nBell was married to former talk show host Lee Phillip Bell, who co-created \"The Young and the Restless\" and \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" with him. Their three children, Bill Jr., Bradley, and Lauralee, and daughter-in-law Maria Arena Bell are all involved in their parents' soaps in some capacity.\n\nBrenda Dickson, an original cast member of The Young and The Restless, claims that Bell blacklisted her after 15 years on the show after they partook in a secret love affair. He then went on to wreak havoc on her personal and professional life by hiring \"Mafia cartel judges and attorneys\" to \"ruin\" her life. As a result, she ended up \"broke and homeless\" and has been blocked from working ever since.\n\nOn April 29, 2005, Bell died at age 78 from complications of Alzheimer's disease. He is buried at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.\n\nHe started out as a comedy writer at WBBM-TV in Chicago, and one day he made a call to Irna Phillips' secretary Rose Cooperman asking her \"Does Irna have an opening?\" Rose said Irna did have an opening. By the time he got there it turned out the guy who was leaving decided to stay. About two years later William J. Bell was in advertising business and he ran into Irna's niece. She mentioned him to Irna and Ms. Phillips remembered who he was; she also knew his wife, who was a celebrity in Chicago at that time. He started out at $75 a week and ended up living in what once was Howard Hughes' villa. His mother regularly listened to radio soap operas: \"Life Can Be Beautiful\", \"The Romance of Helen Trent\", \"Our Gal Sunday\" and \"The Guiding Light\".\n\nHe started his writing career on \"The Guiding Light\" and then moved over to \"As the World Turns\", working under the legendary \"Queen of Soaps,\" Irna Phillips; Phillips' other protegee at the time was Agnes Nixon. Bell co-created \"Another World\" with Phillips in 1964. In 1965, he co-created the primetime \"As the World Turns\" spinoff \"Our Private World\".\n\nIn 1966, he was hired as head writer of the then-struggling soap \"Days of Our Lives\". Bell was credited with the show's initial surge of popularity. Bell changed the dynamics of soaps when he began focusing on sexuality. Formerly, soap operas did not delve into the sexual side of their romances. He intended to leave the show around 1972 when he began creating his own show The Young and the Restless, but the show sued him and he agreed to write long-term story projections for them. He remained as head writer until 1975.\n\nIn 1972, CBS executives wanted a new daytime serial that was youth oriented. William along with his wife Lee Phillip Bell created \"The Young and the Restless\" for the network under the working title, \"The Innocent Years\". However, before the show went into production, he had to rename the series as Bell mentioned...\"\"We were confronted with the very disturbing reality that young America had lost much of its innocence,\"\". \"\"Innocence as we had known and lived it all our lives had, in so many respects, ceased to exist.\"\" They renamed the series to \"The Young and the Restless\" because they felt it \"reflected the youth and mood of the early seventies.\" He spent between ten and sixteen hours a day writing stories.\n\n\"The Young and the Restless\" debuted on March 26, 1973. Although slow to rise in the ratings (he got very frustrated and asked head of CBS Daytime Bud Grant to cancel the serial), CBS had faith in the show and gave it a chance. \"Y&R\" was credited for breathing new life into the daytime serial, with its brightness, humor and cutting-edge storylines. As he did on \"Days of our Lives\", Bell saw to sexuality also playing a major role in the stories. Bell guided \"Y&R\" as head writer from 1973 until stepping down in 1998, the longest tenure of any head writer in soap opera history. \"Y&R\" has been the highest-rated soap on the air since 1988 in households, and 1989 among viewers.\n\nIn 1986, he began working on creating another soap for CBS Daytime, but plans were halted until the end of the year when the network decided to cancel the soap \"Capitol\" and needed a replacement. He created \"The Bold and the Beautiful\", which debuted on March 23, 1987. \"B&B\" is known for its glamorous look as it is set in the fashion industry. It followed \"Y&R\" and has been a ratings success as well.\n\n\n\"Another World\"\n\"As the World Turns\" \n\n\"The Bold and the Beautiful\"\n\n\"Days of Our Lives\"\n\n\"Guiding Light\"\n\n\"Our Private World\"\n\n\"The Young and the Restless\" - Creator (with Lee Phillip Bell)\n\nBell currently holds the distinction of having created the largest number of soap opera characters that are still appearing on the air, with 29 characters on either \"The Young and the Restless\", \"The Bold and the Beautiful\", or \"Days of Our Lives\":\n\n\n",

It was developed by Argonaut Games and published by Jaleco.\n\nIn \"King Arthur's World\", the player controls King Arthur. At the start of each level, only the King is present and various types of troops can be brought out of the tent where he starts. The King and his troops can be commanded to move in a direction, which they do until they receive new orders, are killed or come across enemy troops, which they fight if they can. Also, some troops have special commands, such as for archers to fire arrows.\n\nThe aim of each level is to proceed from the tent at the start to the finishing point. This may require the player to defeat various enemies, avoid traps and obstacles. King Arthur is the only essential character. If he dies, the player has failed and play can only continue if 100 gold coins are spent to rescue him, in which case the player restarts at their tent. The game can be played with a standard controller or, alternatively, with the Super NES Mouse.\n\nIn 2018 it was announced that some of the original makers of the game had reunited to redevelop \"King Arthur's World\", initially for mobile platforms.\n\n",

The Royal Mail postcode is LL71, and it has a population of 1,360, of whom more than 60% is Welsh speaking.\n\nThe village is situated near the centre of Anglesey close to the large water supply reservoir, Llyn Alaw, and is believed to have an ancient foundation. \"Llannerch\" means \"a woodland clearing\". The word \"medd\" in the name is Welsh for mead, which is made from honey, and the name may be related to the production of honey for mead. The disused Anglesey Central Railway runs through the village. Its station, opened in 1866, was closed in 1964 as part of the Beeching Axe, and its goods yard is now a car park. There is now a cafe and tea rooms housed in a modern extension of the old buildings.\n\nJust to the northeast of the village is the hill called Pen y Foel which is 123m above sea level; between 1951 and 1956 this was the site of a VHF Fixer station, part of the RAF Western Sector, and was one of a number similar fixed sites managed by RAF Longley Lane near Preston in Lancashire. The site contained an octagonal wooden hut with a hand-steerable radio mast with two radio receivers of type R1392D, transmitter and telephone line. This hut was protected by a close surrounding octagonal brick wall to provide some bomb blast protection which still exists. The station was used to allow each sector to locate RAF or allied aircraft and to help pilots find airfields in low cloud weather conditions. Also on the hill was a rectangular brick hut (now unroofed) also built by the RAF; this was a simple two-room hut with a rainwater collection tank. The site had three RAF wireless personnel (two were normally on duty) who were billeted with a landlady in Llannerch-y-Medd and attached to nearby RAF Valley. The site closed in around 1956 as the technology was replaced by improved systems.\n\nThe hill Pen y Foel is also the basis for the name of the local Male Voice Choir Cor Meibion Y Foel which is a member of the National Association of Choirs. It has 43 members and rehearses in the village at Capel Ifan. Over the past decade the Choir has supported local Eisteddfodau, competed in the Anglesey Eisteddfod, raised money for numerous charities and has entertained audiences in concerts, weddings and other functions throughout North Wales.\n\nA claim that Mary, the mother of Jesus, is buried in the village forms the subject of Graham Phillips's \"The Marian Conspiracy\". Mary's traditional burial place is near Ephesus, in present-day Turkey.\n\nAn electoral ward exists in the same name.

The majority of reference routes are owned by the state of New York and maintained by NYSDOT; however, some exceptions exist. The reference route designations are normally posted on reference markers, small green signs located every tenth-mile on the side of the road, though a few exceptions exist to this practice as well.\n\nReference route numbers are always three digit numbers in the 900s with a single alphabetic suffix. The designations are largely assigned in numerical and alphabetical order within a region, and designations are not reused once they are removed. Certain letters are avoided, such as \nand \"I\" (used to indicate Interstate Highways and potential confusion with the number 1), \"N\" (used for institutional roads), \"O\" (potential confusion with the number 0), \"R\" (used for reservation roads), \"S\" (potential confusion with the number 5), \"X\" (a designation sometimes used in region 10), and \"Y\" and \"Z\" (at the end of alphabet and not used). \"Q\" and \"U\" are not currently being assigned due to confusion in the past. Designations are assigned as follows:\n\nAn older system of reference route numbering used numbers ranging from 800 to 999 without an alphabetic suffix. Some reference markers with these older numbers still exist, even though these reference routes have new numbers. Every road maintained by NYSDOT also has a state highway (SH) number, used in state laws.\n\nNYSDOT Region 1 primarily covers the Capital District, Saratoga–Champlain and Upper Hudson Valley areas. The counties comprising this region are Albany, Essex, Greene, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, Warren, and Washington.\n\nRegion 2 primarily covers the Central, Mohawk Valley, and south-central Adirondack areas of New York. The counties comprising this region are Fulton, Hamilton, Herkimer, Madison, Montgomery, and Oneida.\n\nRegion 3 primarily covers the eastern Finger Lakes area. The counties comprising this region are Cayuga, Cortland, Onondaga, Oswego, Seneca, and Tompkins.\n\nRegion 4 primarily covers the western Finger Lakes and Genesee Valley areas. The counties comprising this region are Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Ontario, Orleans, Wayne, and Wyoming.\n\nRegion 5 primarily covers the Niagara Frontier and southwestern New York. The counties comprising this region are Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, and Niagara.\n\nRegion 6 primarily covers the western and central portions of the Southern Tier. The counties comprising this region are Allegany, Chemung, Schuyler, Steuben, and Yates. Reference routes for Tioga County are also listed here, as Tioga County was in Region 6 until August 2007.\n\nRegion 7 primarily covers the North Country and the northern portion of the Adirondacks. The counties comprising this region are Clinton, Franklin, Jefferson, Lewis, and St. Lawrence.\n\nRegion 8 primarily covers the Middle and Lower Hudson Valley. The counties comprising this region are Columbia, Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Ulster, and Westchester.\n\nRegion 9 primarily covers the eastern Southern Tier and the Central Leatherstocking and Catskill regions. The counties comprising this region are Broome, Chenango, Delaware, Otsego, Schoharie, and Sullivan. Region 9 also includes Tioga County; however, the reference routes in Tioga County have designations corresponding to Region 6 since the county was part of Region 6 when the routes were assigned.\n\nRegions 10 and 11 collectively cover the core of Downstate New York, with Region 10 covering Long Island and Region 11 covering New York City. As such, Nassau and Suffolk counties comprise Region 10 and the five boroughs of New York City—The Bronx, Brooklyn (Kings County), Manhattan (New York County), Queens, and Staten Island (Richmond County)—comprise Region 11.\n\n\n",

    "text": "ARC (file format)\n\nARC is a lossless data compression and archival format by System Enhancement Associates (SEA). The file format and the program were both called ARC. The format is perhaps best known as the subject of controversy in the 1980s, part of important debates over what would later be known as open formats.\n\nARC was extremely popular during the early days of the dial-up BBS. ARC was convenient as it combined the functions of the SQ program to compress files and the LU program to create .LBR archives of multiple files. The format was later replaced by the ZIP format, which offered better compression ratios and the ability to retain directory structures through the compression/decompression process.\n\nThe .arc filename extension is often used for several file archive-like file types. For example, the Internet Archive uses its own ARC format to store multiple web resources into a single file. The FreeArc archiver also uses .arc extension, but uses a completely different file format. Nintendo uses an unrelated \"ARC\" format for resources, such as MIDI, voice samples, or text, in GameCube and Wii games. Several unofficial extractors exist for this type of ARC file.\n\nIn 1985, Thom Henderson of System Enhancement Associates wrote a program called ARC, based on earlier programs such as ar, that not only grouped files into a single archive file but also compressed them to save disk space, a feature of great importance on early personal computers, where space was very limited and modem transmission speeds were very slow. The archive files produced by ARC had file names ending in \".ARC\" and were thus sometimes called \"arc files\".\n\nThe source code for ARC was released by SEA in 1986 and subsequently ported to Unix and the Atari ST in 1987 by Howard Chu. This more portable codebase was subsequently ported to other platforms, including VAX/VMS and IBM System/370 mainframes. Howard's work was also the first to disprove the prevalent belief that Lempel-Ziv encoded files could not be further compressed. Additional compression could be achieved by using Huffman coding on the LZW data, and Howard's version of ARC was the first program to demonstrate this property. This hybrid technique was later used in several other compression schemes by Phil Katz and others.\n\nLater, Phil Katz developed his own shareware utilities, PKARC and PKXARC, to create archive files and extract their contents. These files worked with the archive file format used by ARC and were significantly faster than ARC on the IBM-PC platform due to selective assembly-language coding. Unlike SEA, which combined archive creation and archive file extraction in a single program, Katz divided these functions between two separate utilities, reducing the amount of memory needed to run them. PKARC also allowed the creation of self-extracting archives, which could unpack themselves without requiring an external file extraction utility.\n\nFollowing the \"System Enhancement Associates, Inc. vs PKWARE Inc. and Phillip W. Katz\" lawsuit, SEA withdrew from the shareware market and developed ARC+Plus. This version included a full-screen user interface, with the last known version being 7.12. SEA was eventually sold to a Japanese company in 1992.\n\nThe ARC format is no longer common on PC desktops, but most antivirus scanners can still uncompress any ARC archives found in order to detect viruses within the compressed files.\n\nIn the late 1980s a dispute arose between SEA, maker of the ARC program, and PKWARE, Inc. (Phil Katz Software). SEA sued Katz for trademark and copyright infringement. An independent software expert, John Navas, was appointed by the court to compare the two programs, and stated that PKARC was a derivative work of ARC, pointing out that comments in both programs were often identical, including spelling errors.\n\nOn August 2, 1988, the plaintiff and defendants announced a settlement of the lawsuit, which included a Confidential Cross-License Agreement under which SEA licensed PKWARE for all the ARC-compatible programs published by PKWARE during the period beginning with the first release of PKXARC in late 1985 through July 31, 1988, in return for an undisclosed payment. In the agreement, PKWARE paid SEA to obtain a license that allowed the distribution of PKWARE's ARC-compatible programs until January 31, 1989, after which PKWARE would not license, publish or distribute any ARC compatible programs or utilities that process ARC compatible files. In exchange, PKWARE licensed SEA to use its source code for PKWARE's ARC-compatible programs. PKWARE also agreed to cease any use of SEA's trademark \"ARC\" and to change the names or marks used with PKWARE's programs to non-confusing designations. The remaining details of the agreement were sealed. In reaching the settlement, the defendants did not admit any fault or wrongdoing. The Wisconsin court order showed defendants were ordered to pay damages to plaintiff for defendants' acts of infringing Plaintiff's copyrights, trademark, and acts of unfair trade practices and unfair competition.\n\nThe leaked agreement document revealed under the settlement terms, the defendants had paid plaintiff $22,500 for past royalty payments, and $40,000 for expense reimbursements. In addition, defendants would pay plaintiff a royalty fee of 6.5% of all revenue received for ARC compatible programs on all orders received after the effective date of this Agreement, such revenue including any license fees or shareware registrations received after the expiration of the license, for ARC compatible programs. In exchange, plaintiff would also pay a commission in the amount of 6.5% of any license fees received by plaintiff from any licensee referred to plaintiff by defendants, whether before or after the license termination date.\n\nAfter the lawsuit, PKWARE released one last version of his PKARC and PKXARC utilities under the new names \"PKPAK\" and \"PKUNPAK\", and from then on concentrated on developing the separate programs PKZIP and PKUNZIP, which were based on new and different file compression techniques and archive file formats. However, following the renaming, SEA filed a lawsuit against PKWARE for contempt, for continually using plaintiff's\nprotected mark ARC, by turning ARC from noun into verb in the PKPAK manual. The U.S. district court of the East District of Wisconsin ruled SEA's motion was denied, and the defendant was entitled to recover the legal cost of $500.\n\nThe SEA vs. PKWARE dispute quickly expanded into one of the largest controversies the BBS world ever saw. The suit by SEA angered many shareware users who perceived that SEA was a \"large, faceless corporation\" and Katz was \"the little guy\". In fact, at the time, both SEA and PKWARE were small home-based companies. However, the community largely sided with Katz, due to the fact that SEA was attempting to retroactively declare the ARC file format to be closed and proprietary. Katz received positive publicity by releasing the APPNOTE.TXT specification documenting the ZIP file format, and declaring that the ZIP file format would always be free for competing software to implement. The net result was that the ARC format quickly dropped out of common use as the predominant compression format that PC-BBSs used for their file archives, and after a brief period of competing formats, the ZIP format was adopted as the predominant standard.\n\nIn an interview, Thom Henderson of SEA said that the main reason he dropped out of software development was because of his inability to emotionally cope with what he claimed was the hate-mail campaign launched against him by Katz.\n\n\n",

    "text": "Blue (Third Eye Blind album)\n\nBlue is the second studio album by American rock band Third Eye Blind, released on November 23, 1999. The album's creation was difficult, namely due to power struggles and arguments between frontman Stephan Jenkins and lead guitarist Kevin Cadogan, leading to a quick but isolated recording experience between members. The album was generally well received by critics, and was certified platinum by the RIAA, but performed below the band's prior album, the multi-platinum \"Third Eye Blind\". While managing to stay together for the creation of the album, shortly after its release, the band fired Cadogan, touring in support of the album with replacement guitarist Tony Fredianelli. As such, the album was the last to feature Cadogan, and the last to be released without significant gaps and delays prior to release.\n\nThe band enjoyed extensive success in 1997 with their first album, \"Third Eye Blind\", which eventually went platinum six times. The band maintained popularity into 1998 through extensive touring and a number of singles that performed well in the charts, including \"Semi-Charmed Life,\" \"How's It Going to Be,\" \"Graduate,\" \"Losing a Whole Year,\" and \"Jumper,\" but by the end of the year, the band looked to start working on new material.\n\nIn promoting the album, frontman and lead vocalist Stephan Jenkins recounted a pleasant experience in recording the album, referring to it as \"too much fun and feeling like...a complete recording group for the first time...We had these jam sessions that were fun\". He also commented that it had been more collaborative than their prior album; bassist Arion Salazar became more involved in the writing and production, while drummer Brad Hargreaves was involved in the creative process for the first time, as he had joined the band late into their sessions for the first album. However, in retrospect, Jenkins painted a much more grim picture, citing time constraints, label pressure from Elektra Records, and isolation between members, stating: \"We did the last album in six months, we just whipped it out, and there's some things on that album, on the second album, that I'm so proud of...but the second album suffered from a kind of coldness almost. That's done in part because we were never in the studio at the same time, never rehearsed the songs together, never played them together. I did my best to, to produce that record and it was very hard to do. Then we succumbed to the time pressures from Elektra to get the album out in six months which we did.\"\n\nA major issue of the recording sessions was internal strife between band members, namely between Jenkins, and lead guitarist and co-founding band-member Kevin Cadogan. The two actively fought for ownership of the band; Cadogan, under the impression that the band was made as an equal partnership, was outraged to find that Jenkins had made legal changes to make Jenkins the sole owner of the band. Cadogan was further frustrated by Salazar's and Hargreaves' lack of understanding and indifference to the arrangement. The album was almost not made at all, as the band manager informed Cadogan that Jenkins was attempting to remove Cadogan from the band prior to even starting work on the album. Cadogan did everything he could to stay in the band, including trying to push issues aside in order to just work on the album, having the band and sound engineer over to his home in order to record rough album ideas for two weeks. The sessions worked, but were very difficult, and ended up being the only period where the band worked together with one another. The rest of the album was recorded in solitude, with each member coming into the studio to record their parts of the album alone. The recording process spread itself across multiple other studios over time, one of which being one of the studios where Fleetwood Mac's \"Rumours\" had been recorded.\n\nThe tension and isolation in the recording process led to complications in the song selection, which would, in turn create further tensions within the band. Firstly was the song \"Slow Motion\", a controversial ballad written by Jenkins about a student shooting a teacher's son. While Jenkins insisted that the song was satirical parody, and actually anti-violence, Elektra disapproved of the track being on the album, feeling it could cause controversy due to the proximity of the Columbine High School massacre, which had just happened in April of that year. The band and the label fought over the song's inclusion for four months, with the label proposing a compromise that would allow only the instrumental to be on the album, and in return, the label would finance an EP to be released after the album, where the band could release the song in its entirety and have complete creative freedom, without restriction. Cadogan, already unhappy with his lack of ownership over the band, was the sole member of the band to object to the deal, knowing he would not have any control over the deal's terms of a cash advance and imprint label creation for the EP.\n\nWith the members of the band not working together at the same time in the studio, the band's manager Eric Godtland set up a voting system for each member of the band to vote for the rest of the songs they wanted included on the album. A list of twenty songs were recorded during \"Blue\"s sessions, with Godtland instructing each member of the band to vote for their top fifteen. In addition to the twelve tracks that made the final track list of \"Blue\" (The thirteenth track, \"Slow Motion\" was not voted upon, as they had already come to a conclusion on what to do with the song.), were an additional eight songs, \"Walk with the Devil\", \"Alright Caroline\", \"Lipstick\", \"Light That Hits the Room/Separation\", \"Sorry\", \"Gorgeous\", \"No One Home\", and \"Pack a Halo\". Adding to the tension between Cadogan and the rest of the band was the fact that many of the songs Cadogan had written, such as \"Light That Hits the Room\", received no votes for inclusion beside his own, and \"Gorgeous\" received only the support of himself and Hargreaves, ultimately leading to the songs being left off the album. Conversely, Cadogan was the sole objector to the tracks \"Never Let You Go\" and \"Deep Inside of You\", which were not only included on the album, but eventually made singles. Elektra spokesman Joel Amsterdam revealed that \"Horror Show\", a track the band had recorded and released originally on the \"How's It Going to Be\" single and for the \"Varsity Blues\" soundtrack, was also in contention for the album, but ultimately left off.\n\nNot wanting to be pigeonholed into the pop rock genre after the success of \"Semi-Charmed Life\" from their debut, the band aimed to have a more experimental and harder-edged rock sound to their second album. Cadogan personally aimed for the album's sound to reflect all of the music he had encountered, due to it always being planned as one of the last albums released in the 20th century. As such, the individual songs spanned many genre and lyrical themes. The album's opening track and first single, \"Anything\", was described as pop punk. \"Wounded\" was described by Jenkins as \"a chronicle of a friend's sexual assault\", while \"10 Days Late\" was described as an \"ambiguous [song] about abortion\". However, when Jenkins was interviewed by \"Billboard\", he claimed the song was about a friend of his who had gotten his girlfriend pregnant at a young age; Jenkins was the baby's godfather. \"Slow Motion\" was Jenkins' satirical commentary on how the media and Hollywood glorifies violence. While the lyrics were seen as controversial due to the album's release close to the Columbine High School massacre, they were not about the incident, and were actually written years prior in 1995, though the label still requested their removal for the final release of the album.\n\nThe album debuted at number 40 on the US \"Billboard\" 200, selling about 75,000 copies in its first week of release. \"Blue\" was certified platinum by the RIAA by April 2000, and had sold over 1.25 million copies in the U.S. as of May 2003. Two variants of the album were released; a first pressing with \"Slow Motion\" with a chorus as track 11, and later pressings with it as an instrumental at the very end of the album. Four singles were released to pop and rock radio, including \"Anything\", \"Never Let You Go\", \"Ten Days Late\", and \"Deep Inside of You\". The band also toured vigorously in support of the album, including their \"Dragons and Astronauts\" tour.\n\nJust after the touring in support of \"Blue\" began, on January 25, 2000, Cadogan was fired from the band. Tony Fredianelli, who had some limited experience with the band previously, joined the band shortly thereafter, filling in for the rest of the touring cycle. Cadogan subsequently sued Third Eye Blind for breach of contract, with a settlement of an undisclosed amount permanently ending the relationship. Third Eye Blind would go on to put out two more albums with Fredianelli, albeit with very long delays, \"Out of the Vein\" (2003) and \"Ursa Major\" (2009), until similar power struggles between Fredianelli and Jenkins led to similar firings and lawsuits between the two in 2010. Cadogan mostly kept to low-profile projects, largely three solo albums, \"12 Nights in Studio A\" (2002), \"Wunderfoot\" (2003), and \"Thousand Yard Stare\" (2006). Notably, a number of versions of his songs written, but ultimately rejected for, \"Blue\" ended up on the album \"Wunderfoot\", including \"Lipstick\", \"Pack a Halo\" (reworked into \"Palpatations\"), \"Walk With the Devil\" (reworked into \"Waiting for Me\"). \n\nThe contentious full lyric version of \"Slow Motion\" never appeared on a later EP, as the \"Black\" EP, later re-titled \"Symphony of Decay\", was never released, but the song was eventually released in 2006 on the greatest hits album \"A Collection\". Despite the difficult recording sessions and strife among members, in a 2015 \"Vice\" retrospective, Jenkins rated the album as his favorite of the band's releases, feeling that the album marked a sweet spot in the band's career, where they had freedom due to the prior album's success, but hadn't developed a fear of failing to create a followup yet.\n\nThe album was generally well received by critics. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the album for proving that they're \"stronger and more serious than many of their post-grunge peers\" and concluding that \"there's not quite enough of it this time around to make \"Blue\" the equal of its predecessor, but it should be enough to please devoted fans.\" \"The A.V. Club\" writer Stephen Thompson agreed, noting that \"its second half is particularly aimless and dire—but it's got its moments, particularly the sparkly, hitworthy single 'Never Let You Go' and 'Anything,' which opens the album with two minutes of pop joy.\" In a mixed review from \"Spin\", Mark Lepage remarked that the band were \"lightweights trying their hooks out on the heavy bag,\" noticing influences from the Rolling Stones, U2, and Kiss.\n\nJames Hunter of \"Rolling Stone\" praised the album for its \"finely worked-out chunks of serious gun-metal rockcraft that depend on the San Francisco band's restless, edgy electric guitars\" and concluded that the album was a rarity in the way it \"works best as either background rock or intimate headphone material.\" Elysa Gardner of \"Entertainment Weekly\" noted Jenkins' lyrics and vocal delivery and Cadogan's guitar-work as standout elements of the album.\n\n\n",

    "text": "Ages in Chaos\n\nAges in Chaos is a book by the controversial writer Immanuel Velikovsky, first published by Doubleday in 1952, which put forward a major revision of the history of the Ancient Near East, claiming that the histories of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Israel are five centuries out of step. He followed this with a number of other works where he attempted to complete his reconstruction of ancient history, collectively known as the \"Ages in Chaos\" series.\n\nVelikovsky's work has been harshly criticised, including even by some fellow chronological revisionists.\n\nVelikovsky had put forward his ideas briefly in \"Theses for the Reconstruction of Ancient History\" in 1945, where he claimed that the history of the ancient Near East down to the time of Alexander the Great is garbled, but \"Ages in Chaos\" was his first full-length work on the subject.\n\nHis starting point for the first volume of the series was that the Exodus took place not, as orthodoxy has it, at some point during the Egyptian New Kingdom, but at the fall of the Middle Kingdom. In this and later volumes, he made heavy use of the concept of \"ghost doubles\" or alter-egos: historical figures who were known by different names in two different sources (e.g. Egyptian and Greek) and were considered to be entirely different people living in different centuries, but who he proposed to be actually erroneously dated accounts of the same individuals and events.\n\nFirst he claimed that the Ipuwer Papyrus came from the beginning of Egypt's Second Intermediate Period, and that this was an Egyptian account of the Plagues of Egypt. He then identified Tutimaios as the Pharaoh of the Exodus (much earlier than any of the mainstream candidates), the Hyksos with the biblical Amalekites, the Egyptian Pharaoh Hatshepsut with the Biblical Queen of Sheba, the land of Punt with Solomon's kingdom, and Pharaoh Thutmose III with the Biblical King Shishak. He claimed that the Egyptian Amarna letters from the late 18th Dynasty describe events from the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, from roughly the time of King Ahab.\n\nA second volume was due for publication shortly after this but was postponed. Instead it was followed in 1960 by \"Oedipus and Akhnaton\", where he claimed that the story of the Pharaoh Akhenaten was the origin of the Greek legend of Oedipus, and that Amenophis III was Laius, and Tutankhamun was Eteocles.\n\nIn the last two years of his life Velikovsky published a further two volumes of the series. In \"Peoples of the Sea\" he dealt with the final period of his reconstruction, the Persian invasions of Egypt. Manetho's 20th dynasty here becomes identified with the dynasties which ruled a newly independent Egypt in the early 4th century BCE, and Nectanebo I is a ghost double of Rameses III. Rameses III fought invasions by the Sea Peoples, including the \"Peleset\", conventionally identified with the Philistines. According to Velikovsky, the \"Peleset\" are actually the Persians and the other Sea Peoples are their Greek mercenaries. The 21st dynasty then becomes a line of priest-kings who ruled in the oases simultaneously with the Persians.\nIn \"Ramses II and His Time\" Velikovsky identified each of the major 19th dynasty pharaohs with a corresponding pharaoh of the 26th dynasty. Thus, Ramses I was an alter-ego of Necho I, Seti I of Psamtik I, Ramses II of Necho II, and Merneptah of Apries. In order to make these identifications work, Velikovsky claimed that the Hittite Empire was an invention of modern historians, and the supposedly Hittite archaeological remains in modern Turkey were actually Chaldean, i.e. Neo-Babylonian. The Hittite kings are held to be ghost doubles of the Neo-Babylonian kings, and Rameses II's battle with the Hittites at Kadesh is identical to Necho's fight against Nebuchadrezzar II at Carchemish, Nabopolassar is Mursili II, Neriglissar is Muwatalli, Labashi-Marduk is Urhi-Teshup, and Nebuchadrezzar II is Hattusili III.\n\nAt the time of his death he considered that completing his reconstruction of ancient history would require a further two volumes: \"The Assyrian Conquest\" and \"The Dark Age of Greece\"; these were never published in print in English, but online versions are available at the Velikovsky archive. In the former work, Velikovsky separated the 18th and 19th dynasties, specifically arguing that over a century separated Ay and Horemheb, conventionally regarded as his successor. Instead, he had the 22nd through 25th dynasties follow upon the earlier part of the 18th, leading down to the Assyrian invasions of the early 7th century BCE. The \"great king\" who crowned Horemheb was the Assyrian king.\n\nThe books have remained popular. The British publisher Sidgwick & Jackson reprinted \"Ages in Chaos\" ten times between 1953 and 1977, and Paradigma reprinted it as recently as 2009.\n\nThe revised chronology proposed by \"Ages in Chaos\" has been rejected by nearly all mainstream historians and Egyptologists. It was claimed, starting with early reviewers, that Velikovsky's usage of material for proof is often very selective. In 1965 the leading cuneiformist Abraham Sachs, in a forum at Brown University, discredited Velikovsky's use of Mesopotamian cuneiform sources. Velikovsky was never able to refute Sachs' attack.\n\nIn 1984 fringe science expert Henry H. Bauer wrote \"Beyond Velikovsky: The History of a Public Controversy\", which \"Time\" described as \"the definitive treatise debunking Immanuel Velikovsky\". Bauer accused Velikovsky of dogmatically asserting his own point of view to be correct, where at best this is only one possible interpretation of the historical material in question, and gives several examples from \"Ages in Chaos\".\n\nIn 1984 Egyptologist David Lorton produced a detailed critique of chapter 3 of \"Ages in Chaos\", which identifies Hatshepsut with the Queen of Sheba, e.g. accusing Velikovsky of mistakes that he would have avoided if he had a basic knowledge of the languages of the ancient near east.\n\nIn 1978, following the much-postponed publication of further volumes in Velikovsky's \"Ages in Chaos\" series, the United Kingdom-based Society for Interdisciplinary Studies organised a conference in Glasgow specifically to debate the revised chronology. The ultimate conclusion of this work, by scholars including Peter James, John Bimson, Geoffrey Gammonn, and David Rohl, was that this particular revision of chronology was untenable, although they considered that the work had highlighted problems with the orthodox chronology.\n\nDavid Rohl, one of those involved in the 1978 Glasgow conference, has developed his own revised chronology. While he agrees that the Exodus should be dated to the collapse of the Middle Kingdom, and that Tutimaios is the Pharaoh of the Exodus, there are few points of contact between the Velikovsky and Rohl chronologies, largely because of the different methodologies used to resolve the later periods.\n\nJames, another Glasgow delegate who went on to publish a work challenging the concept of a widespread dark age at the end of the Bronze Age, credited Velikovsky with \"point[ing] the way to a solution by challenging Egyptian chronology\", but criticised Velikovsky's chronology as \"disastrously extreme\", producing \"a rash of new problems far more severe than those it hoped to solve\" and noted that \"Velikovsky understood little of archaeology and nothing of stratigraphy\".\n\nOne important disagreement is that Rohl and James consider that the chronology of the ancient Near East becomes fixed by the conquests of the Assyrians in the 7th century BCE. Velikovsky carried his revisionism into the Late Period of ancient Egypt, and considered that chronology only becomes fixed by the conquests of Alexander the Great in the 4th century BCE. They have also rejected some of Velikovsky's more extreme claims e.g. non-existence of Hittite Empire, changing the order of some Egyptian dynasties. Rohl and James's views remain controversial and are not accepted by most historians.\n\nIn spite of the hostility of mainstream historians, Velikovsky's revisionism continues to attract adherents. Following his death in 1979 Velikovsky's theories were championed by Lynn E. Rose, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at Buffalo. After Rose's death in 2013 the torch passed to a small group of disciples, among whom the most vocal and active are Charles Ginenthal and Emmet Sweeney. Ginenthal is the founder and principal contributor to an online journal \"The Velikovskian\". He has also authored a series of revisionist works under the title \"Pillars of the Past\". Emmet Sweeney has published his chronological revisions in a series of works entitled \"Ages in Alignment\".\n\nThese scholars believe that Velikovsky did not go far enough. Under the influence of Gunnar Heinsohn they have shortened Velikovsky's timeline of ancient history even more. The 12th Dynasty of ancient Egypt has been moved almost 1500 years closer to the present, ending with Alexander the Great's invasion in 331 BC. The Exodus has been redated to the 8th century, and the 18th Dynasty has been moved to the 8th–7th centuries. 274 years have been removed from the history of the Israelites. The Hittite Empire, which Velikovsky identified with the Neo-Babylonian Empire, has been identified with the Lydian Kingdom, while the Neo-Babylonians are now regarded as vassal kings of Babylon under the Macedonian Seleucids. The Neo-Assyrian Empire is now equated with the Persian Empire in northern Assyria and has been redated accordingly. In truth, very little of Velikovsky's chronology has been left untouched.\n\nLittle if any of these authors' work has been endorsed by mainstream historians.\n\n",

    "text": "Democratic Labour Party (Trinidad and Tobago)\n\nThe Democratic Labour Party (DLP) was the main opposition party in Trinidad and Tobago between 1957 and 1971. The party was the party which opposed the People's National Movement (PNM) at the time of Independence. After several splits brought about by leadership struggles, the party lost its hold on the Indo-Trinidadian community in the 1976 General Elections and was displaced in parliament by the United Labour Front under the leadership of Basdeo Panday. The party was the representative of the ethnic Indian community in the country; however Indian Muslims were said to be less loyal to the party than Indian Hindus.\n\nThe party symbol was a flaming torch.\n\nThe DLP was formed through the merger of three Opposition parties in the Legislative Council, the People's Democratic Party, the Trinidad Labour Party and the Party of Political Progress Groups. Also joining was Stephen Maharaj, a member of the Butler Party. The three parties aligned with the Democratic Labour Party of the West Indies Federation under the leadership of Sir Alexander Bustamante and merged to form a single national party. The DLP defeated the PNM in the 1958 Federal Elections, winning six of the ten seats in the Federal Parliament.\n\nShortly thereafter the party began to disintegrate. Bhadase Sagan Maraj, the first leader of the party in the Legislative Council, became ill, bedridden and overly reliant on pethidine. Dr. Rudranath Capildeo was elected party leader in 1960; he was brought into the party to provide an \"intellectual equal\" to Eric Williams. When Capildeo left Trinidad to teach at the University of London, a faction of the party called a general meeting and elected Albert Gomes party leader. However, the rank and file of the party stood behind Capildeo, and the Gomes faction left the party.\n\n1961 saw the introduction of the \"Representation of the People Act\", which modernized the election process by instituting identification cards, voting machines, and altered the way in which constituencies were laid out. The DLP viewed this as an attempt to disenfranchise Indo-Trinidadian voters. Indo-Trinidadians were less educated and suspicious of authorities. The DLP claimed that Indo-Trinidadians would be less likely to register, and might be intimidated by \"complicated\" voting machines. They also accused the PNM of gerrymandering the constituencies to maximise the impact of PNM supporters and minimise the impact of DLP supporters.\n\nConsequently, the 1961 General Election campaign was extremely tense and racially polarised. The DLP alleged that voting machines were rigged. These allegations found support when initial returns showed PNM candidate A.N.R. Robinson receiving more votes than there were registered electors in his constituency. The PNM secured a two-thirds majority (20 of 30 seats) in Parliament.The DLP won the remaining 10 seats. When the Federation was dissolved in 1961 (following the withdrawal of Jamaica), this majority allowed the PNM to write the Independence Constitution without input from the DLP. In response to allegations of voting irregularities the DLP boycotted the opening of parliament and operated largely through boycotts and walk-outs.\n\nIn 1963 Rudranath Capildeo accepted a permanent position at the University of London and attempted to run the DLP and serve as Leader of the Opposition while based in London. He was able to retain his seat in Parliament through special dispensation from the Speaker of the House, Arnold Thomasos. In March of that year Capildeo gave the party a new creed, \"Democratic Socialism\". This action, coupled with Capildeo's absentee rulership, led to a revolt in the party executive, and this resulted in the appointment of Stephen Maharaj (a former Butler Party member) as Leader of the Opposition, while Capildeo retained the post of Party Leader. When the executive tried to replace Capildeo with Maharaj as Party leader, Capildeo dismissed the executive. In response to this on January 13, 1964 three MPs, Dr. Montgomery Forrester, Peter Farquahar and Tajmool Hosein resigned from the party and formed the Liberal Party.\n\nIndependence left the two main industries, sugar and oil in the hands of foreign multi-national corporations (Tate & Lyle in sugar, Shell, British Petroleum and Texaco in oil). The labour unions interpreted this as evidence that the PNM and DLP leadership had sold out to foreign corporations. George Weekes, an anti-PNM Afro-Trinidadian trade unionist, gained control of the Oilfields Workers' Trade Union, while Krishna Gowandan challenged Bhadase Maraj's leadership of the All Trinidad Sugar Estates and Factory Workers Union. In March 1965 15,000 sugar workers went on strike. Williams responded by declaring a State of Emergency and suspending civil rights. This brought the Afro-Trinidadian-dominated Trade Union Congress into alliance with the (Indo-Trinidadian) sugar workers.\n\nIn response to labour unrest in 1965, the PNM government introduced the \"Industrial Stabilisation Act\" (ISA), which banned strike action in the public service and restricted the use of strikes and lock-outs in private industry. In the spirit of \"democratic socialism\" Stephen Maharaj instructed his MPs to vote against the bill. However, two Members of the House (Ashford Sinanan and Lionel Seukeran), and all four Senators voted in favour of the bill. This led to a split in the party, with three separate wings vying for power. The centrist wing was led by Vernon Jamadar, the radical wing by Stephen Maharaj and the conservative wing by Lionel Seukaran and Ashford Sinanan. Maharaj, as Leader of the Opposition, attempted to remove the DLP Senators and replace them with leftists C.L.R. James, George Weekes (both Afro-Trinidadians), Adrian Cola Rienzi (an Indo-Trinidadian and former ally of T.U.B. Butler in the Labour riots of 1937), and Jack Kelshall (a white Trinidadian socialist and former advisor to Cheddi Jagan).\n\nAs Leader of the Opposition, Maharaj had the ability to appoint and dismiss Opposition Senators. In June, in response to the failure of the DLP Senators to oppose the ISA, Maharaj wrote the Governor General Sir Solomon Hochoy and asked him to revoke the appointment of the Senators and replace them with James, Rienzi and Clive Phil. Instead, based on the advice of the conservative wing of the party (which had the support of four MPs), Hochoy revoked Maharaj's appointment and replaced him with Simbhoonath Capildeo (Rudranath Capildeo's older brother).\n\nThroughout all this Rudranath Capildeo remained party leader. He had selected Maharaj to be Leader of the Opposition and had opposed the ISA. However, rather than take a side in the dispute he remained vague, until he returned from England in July. Upon arrival he denounced Simbhoonath Capildeo as the main troublemaker in the party, and accused him of hiring a hit man to kill him. He met with Maharaj, James, Kelshall and Rienzi and promised to mobilise the DLP to oppose the ISA. The following day he denounced James, Maharaj and Rienzi of plotting against the interest of the party. He dismissed his brother as Leader of the Opposition and replaced him with Jamadar. In response to these actions, the DLP split again. Stephen Maharaj formed the Workers and Farmers Party (together with Weekes, James and a young Basdeo Panday), Simbhoonath Capildeo resigned from the DLP and joined the Liberal Party and Lionel Seukaran became an Independent. This left the DLP and the Liberals each holding four seats, the WFP holding one, and Seukaran holding the other as an Independent. Seukeran formed the Seukeran Independent Party (SIP) as a means of organizing his supporters.\n\nThe 1966 General Elections allowed the DLP to return to its position as the sole opposition party. The DLP won 12 of 36 seats. The WFP, SIP and the Liberal Party failed to win any seats. Rudranath Capildeo's continued absences led to his seat being declared vacant in 1967. When the DLP chose to boycott the by-election in protest, Bhadase Sagan Maraj was able to return to Parliament by winning the seat as an Independent.\n\nIn 1969, Vernon Jamadar was able to capture the party leadership from Capildeo. Following the Black Power riots and army mutiny in 1970, the DLP allied itself with former PNM Deputy Leader, A.N.R. Robinson, and his new movement, the Action Committee of Democratic Citizens (ACDC). When Williams called elections 6 months early, Robinson declared that he would not contest the election and called upon supporters to boycott the election. Despite reservations, the DLP ended up supporting Robinson in his \"no vote\" campaign.\n\nHoping to capitalize on the DLP's absence Bhadase Sagan Maraj formed the Democratic Liberation Party. Among the candidates fielded were Stephen Maharaj, Lional Seukeran and Satnarayan Maharaj. Nevertheless, this party failed to make headway against the DLP's \"No-Vote\" campaign and won no seats.\n\nThanks to the boycott, the PNM won all seats in the 1971 General Elections. Many in the party felt betrayed by Robinson's actions, but the boycott resulted in a switch from voting machines to paper ballots.\n\nAlloy Lequay ousted Jamadar as party leader in 1972. This led to Vernon Jamadar breaking off and forming the Social Democratic Labour Party. The rump DLP then merged with the remnants of the Liberal Party and renamed itself the United Democratic Labour Party, now led by Simbhoonath Capildeo. Another faction led by Ashford Sinanan emerged and called itself the West Indian National Party (WINP). None of the successor parties won any seats in the 1976 General Elections. The new United Labour Front was able to totally displace the DLP from its core Indo-Trinidadian constituency. Jamadar and Lequay both contested the Siparia constituency (among eight candidates), but were soundly beaten by the ULF's Raffique Shah. That spelt the end of their political careers. Basdeo Panday later led the people who supported the party into the National Alliance for Reconstruction (which brought Indo-Trinidadians into power as part of a multi-racial coalition), and finally into power as the dominant faction in the United National Congress government between 1995 and 2001.\n\nNone of the principles of the DLP played a significant role in party politics after the demise of the party. Simboonath Capildeo and Vernon Jamadar returned to their respective legal practices. Satnarayan Maharaj took over control of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha after the death of his father-in-law, Bhadase Sagan Maraj in 1971. Alloy Lequay went on to play a distinguished role as President and CEO of the Trinidad & Tobago Cricket Board, from which he retired in 2005.\n\nThe DLP originated from the merger of the People's Democratic Party (PDP), the Trinidad Labour Party (TLP) and the Party of Political Progress Groups (POPPG). The PDP was a conservative party of the Indo-Trinidadian middle and upper-middle class with a primarily Brahmin Hindu leadership. The POPPG was a party of the white and near-white middle and upper-middle class, a small but economically powerful group. The Trinidad Labour Party was a working-class party, but had seen its support decline from 12% of the electorate in 1946 to 5% in 1956. Both the PDP and the POPPG had achieved electoral support by appealing to the Indo-Trinidadian and Afro-Trinidadian working classes, but the rise of the PNM split the Afro-Trinidadians away from the POPPG. By appealing to Sanatanist Hindus on religious and racial grounds, the DLP was able to entrench itself among Hindu Trinidadians, but the race-based appeal of the 1961 election campaign alienated the non-Indian middle class elements. Rudranath Capildeo's adoption of Democratic Socialism was an attempt to create a stronger link with the party's base, but it widened the rift with the middle class. By the early 1970s the party leadership was almost entirely Brahmin Hindu or Presbyterian Indian.\n\nThe DLP never held political power, limiting its impact on the overall direction of Trinidad and Tobago. In addition, unlike the PNM, which had a strong central leadership (in the person of Eric Williams), the DLP lacked a united leadership. The loss of the Gomes faction in 1960 and Farquahar, Forrester and Hosein in 1964 resulted in the loss of a section of the population which would remain unrepresented politically until the formation of the Organisation for National Reconstruction in 1981. Eric Williams had managed to attract much of the Muslim and Presbyterian portions of the Indo-Trinidadian population to the PNM. Even though these groups later drifted away from the PNM, Muslims remained an important constituency within the PNM until 1986.\n\nFaced with the opportunity to expand the party through alliance with labour leaders, Rudranath Capildeo chose to steer the party away from this block. Rather than share power within the party with Afro-Trinidadians, Capildeo chose to remain permanently in Opposition. As the PNM moved away from racially threatening rhetoric, the DLP leadership was able to build a relationship with them. Many within the party accused the leadership of selling out the rank and file in exchange for political favours, but the purge of 1965 ensured that no-one remained in the party with enough personal support to be able to challenge the leadership.\n\nThe labour unrest of the 1960s and the Black Power movement of the early 1970s created other blocks of opposition to the PNM, but the DLP leadership was not able to attract these groups to their orbit. Instead, the opposition remained fragmented and disunited until the rise of the National Alliance for Reconstruction in 1986.\n\n\n\n",

The parish was founded on March 25, 1913, with the first building being a simple chapel. The current building, 194 Fourth Avenue, was built in 1931.\n\nA brass memorial plaque was erected by the Blessed Sacrament parish in memory of parishioners and comrades of the overseas military forces of Canada. It was unveiled on Armistice Day (11 November) 1920 by Reverent John J. O'Gorman, P.P. \nWhen the current building opened in 1932, its plain design and lack of ornamentation caused local controversy because it seemed more Protestant than Catholic. However, the building later won plaudits for its modern design. Designed by John Gibb Morton, it is considered an example of the Perpendicular Gothic style.\n\nA memorial organ was unveiled on Christmas 1946, in memory of the parishioners who gave their lives in World War II.\n\nAs with Ottawa's other old churches, declining church attendance had caused problems for the church. For several years it served as home to Ottawa's Hungarian Catholic community, though they left in 1997. Church attendance began to increase dramatically when Ottawa Archbishop Marcel Gervais appointed the popular priest Fr. Joseph (Joe) LeClair as pastor. Fr Galen Bank was installed as pastor at Blessed Sacrament in July 2013. Father Galen, along with Associate Pastor Fr Francis Donnelly, have followed in the footsteps of Blessed Sacrament's founder Fr O'Gorman by reaching out to and working with the parish community.\n\nThe church's parish retains its original form. It covers the area north and west of the Rideau Canal, south of the Queensway and east of Booth Street.\n\n",

    "text": "Out of the Vein\n\nOut of the Vein is the third studio album by American rock band Third Eye Blind. Released on May 13, 2003, \"Out of the Vein\" is the band's first album with guitarist Tony Fredianelli, who replaced longtime guitarist Kevin Cadogan in 2000. It would also be Third Eye Blind's final album with Elektra Records.\n\n\"Out of the Vein\" was recorded at the group's own Mourning Wood Studios in downtown San Francisco and at Skywalker Sound. Frontman Stephan Jenkins wanted the album to be called \"Crystal Baller\", but was changed as the other members hated the original name.\n\n\"Out of the Vein\" was originally scheduled to be released in the Spring of 2002, but was delayed several times. According to Jenkins, some of the reasons for the delay stemmed from a self-imposed pressure to live up to Third Eye Blind's previous successes, leading him to rewrite lyrics. By the time the album was released, Elektra Records was in the midst of being absorbed into Atlantic Records, and Jenkins contends the group was not a priority: \"Our record company ceased to exist the month the record was released,\" \"Elektra Records imploded. It was just letterhead.\"\n\nJenkins felt that \"Out of the Vein\" would mark \"A new period for the band\", and added that \"The first two albums were like two parts of the same piece. We've had a hiatus. This is a new beginning. We're developing a songbook that's getting richer.\"\n\nThe album cover is by photographer Mick Rock, and according to Jenkins screams \"rock joy\". The first 100,000 copies of the CD included a DVD documenting the making of the album. The DVD also contains footage of the band practicing songs off the album (such as \"Faster\") in the studio and plays clips of a song that has yet to be released titled Invisible.\n\nThe vinyl version of the album, released in 2013 for the first time, includes different mixes of many songs from the original album.\n\nThe album had a strong debut at #12 on the \"Billboard\" 200 with 63,000 copies sold in its first week. While \"Out of the Vein\" has yet to be certified by the RIAA, the album has sold about 500,000 copies as of March 2007.\n\nThird Eye Blind\n\nArtwork\n\nAdditional musicians\nProduction\n",

    "text": "Jean Henri Latude\n\nJean Henri Latude (23 March 1725 – 1 January 1805), often called Danry or Masers de Latude, was a French writer famous for his lengthy confinement in the Bastille, at Vincennes, and for his repeated escapes from those prisons.\n\nHe was born at Montagnac in Gascony. He received a military education and went to Paris in 1748 to study mathematics. He led a dissipated life and endeavoured to curry favor with the marquise de Pompadour by secretly sending her a box of poison and then informing her of the supposed plot against her life, hoping that he could earn a reward of cash for warning her. The ruse was discovered, and Mme de Pompadour, not appreciating the humor of the situation, had Latude put in the Bastille on 1 May 1749.\n\nHe was later transferred to Vincennes, from which he escaped in 1750. Captured and reimprisoned in the Bastille, he made a second brief escape in 1756. He was again transferred to Vincennes in 1764, and the next year made a third escape and was a third time recaptured. He was put in a madhouse by Malesherbes in 1775, and discharged in 1777 on condition that he should retire to his native town.\nHe remained in Paris, however, and he was again imprisoned. A certain Madame Legros became interested in him through a chance reading of one of his memoirs, and, through vigorous agitation in his behalf, secured his release in 1784. His considerable ability for mimicry and intrigue were evidenced throughout his long captivity; he posed as a brave military officer, a son of the non-existent marquis de La Tude, and as a victim of Pompadour's nefarious intrigues. He was lauded and pensioned during the Revolution, and, in 1793, the Convention compelled the heirs of Madame de Pompadour to pay him 60,000 francs in damages. He died famous and wealthy in Paris in 1805.\n\nThe principal work of Latude is the account of his imprisonment, written in collaboration with Jean-Yrieix de Beaupoil de Saint-Aulaire entitled \"Le Despotisme dévoilé, ou Mémoires de Henri Masers de la Tude, détenu pendant trente-cinq ans dans les diverses prisons d'état\" (Ostensibly Amsterdam, but actually published in Paris, 1787). An English translation of a portion of this work (\"Despotism Unveiled: or the Memoirs of Latude, Detained for Thirty-five Years in the Various Prisons of the State\") was published in 1787. Latude himself denied both the authorship and the accuracy of the pamphlet, but it enjoyed a considerable popularity at the time of the French Revolution. Latude also wrote essays on a wide variety of subjects.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Brian Bennett\n\nBrian Laurence Bennett, (born 9 February 1940 in Palmers Green, North London, England) is an English drummer, pianist, composer and producer of popular music. He is best known as the drummer of the UK rock and roll group The Shadows. He is father of musician and Shadows band member Warren Bennett.\n\nEducated at Hazlewood Lane School, Palmers Green, London and Winchmore Council School, he finished school at the age of sixteen to play drums in a Ramsgate skiffle group performing for holiday makers. After returning to London he became the in-house drummer at The 2i's Coffee Bar in Soho and was a regular performer on Jack Good's TV show \"Oh Boy!\"\n\nHe then became a member of Marty Wilde's Wildcats in 1959. After a successful period with the Wildcats, during which he appeared on their instrumental record without Wilde (recorded as the Krew Kats), \"Trambone\", he backed Tommy Steele for some of his London stage performances, and then in October 1961 he joined Cliff Richard and the Shadows as the replacement for Tony Meehan.\n\nIn 1967, Bennett released a solo album of jazz music, entitled \"Change of Direction\", in mono and stereo (neither charted). This was the first solo album by a member of the Shadows. In the 1970s, music by Bennett was selected for several Radley Metzger films, including \"Barbara Broadcast\" and \"The Opening of Misty Beethoven\".\n\nHe stayed with the group throughout all of their subsequent line-ups, and in May 2005 took part in the Shadows' European tour. During a show in Reykjavík, Iceland he sustained what was thought to be a minor injury to a finger. A splinter from a drumstick pierced under his fingernail on his right hand, he removed it with a pair of old pliers and applied a plaster. A few days later after arriving in Paris, France he was in so much pain he called a doctor. The doctor diagnosed a bad infection and recommended Bennett go to hospital immediately. Thinking it would be a short visit he attended only to find out that it would involve a minor, but very painful, operation to remove the poison. He was due to be playing on stage that evening and had already missed the soundcheck. He arrived at the theatre 15 minutes before the show with his right-hand bandaged and still numb from the anaesthetic. He managed to play for the whole show using an altered playing style.\n\nIn addition to his work with the Shadows he has also appeared in Cliff Richard's backing band and plays piano and occasionally vibraphone.\n\nHe has composed many popular TV theme tunes including BBC sports themes such as \"Rugby Special\" (\"Holy Mackerel\") and BBC Golf (\"Chase Side Shoot Up\"), Channel 9 Australia's cricket theme (\"New Horizons\"), the sitcoms \"Robin's Nest\" and \"Birds of a Feather\", \"The Ruth Rendell Mysteries\", \"Pulaski\", \"Square Deal\", \"Close to Home\", \"Murder in Mind\" and, with his son Warren, composed and played the incidental music in \"New Tricks\". Two of his most famous works were \"The Journey\" and \"Just a Minute\" written under the alias James Aldenham and used for the \"ITV Schools on 4\" broadcasts between 1987–1993. He scored the British-German film \"The Harpist\" in 1999.\n\nHe is also an orchestral conductor, having learned how to arrange and conduct music for orchestras from a correspondence course. His son Warren Bennett formerly played keyboards for the band Glass Ties, and is also a composer and producer.\n\nHe was appointed OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2004 Queen's Birthday Honours List for services to music.\n\nBennett runs a home recording studio, Honeyhill studios, in Radlett, Hertfordshire.\nIn November 2009, at the age of 69, Bennett completed a 50th Anniversary reunion world tour with Cliff Richard and the Shadows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Dhyan Chand\n\nDhyan Chand (29 August 1905 – 3 December 1979) was an Indian hockey player and one of the greatest hockey players in the history of the sport. He was known for his extraordinary goal-scoring feats, in addition to earning three Olympic gold medals, in 1928, 1932 and 1936, during an era where India dominated field hockey. His influence extended beyond these victories, as India won the field hockey event in seven out of eight Olympics from 1928 to 1964. It is believed that after India defeated Germany in the 1936 Olympics final 8-1, Adolf Hitler offered him a senior post in the German Army, to which Chand refused.\n\nKnown as \"The Wizard\" or \"The Magician\" \"of hockey\" for his superb ball control, Chand played internationally from 1926 to 1949; he scored 570 goals in 185 matches according to his autobiography, \"Goal\". The Government of India awarded Chand India's third highest civilian honour of Padma Bhushan in 1956. His birthday, 29 August, is celebrated as National Sports Day in India every year.\n\nDhyan Chand was born in Allahabad on August 29, 1905 in a Rajput family. He was the elder brother of another hockey player Roop Singh, and the son of Sharadha Singh and Sameshwar Singh. Dhyan Chand's father was enlisted in the British Indian Army, and he played hockey for the army. Dhyan Chand had two brothers – Mool Singh and Roop Singh. Because of his father's numerous army transfers, the family had to move to different cities and as such Chand had to terminate his education after only six years of schooling. The family finally settled in Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, India. \n\nDhyanchand graduated from Victoria College, Gwalior in 1932. Being in the military, his father got a small piece of land for a house.\n\nYoung Chand had no serious inclination towards sports, though he loved wrestling. He stated that he did not remember whether he played any hockey worth mentioning before he joined the Army, though he said that he occasionally indulged in casual games in Jhansi with his friends.\n\nThe Hindi word \"Chand\" literally means the moon. Since Dhyan Singh used to practice a lot during the night after his duty hours, he used to wait for the moon to come out so that the visibility in the field (during his era there were no flood lights) improved. He was hence called \"Chand\", by his fellow players, as his practice sessions at night invariably coincided with the coming out of the moon.\n\nOn 29 August 1922 - his 17th birthday - Chand enlisted in the 1st Brahmans of the British Indian Army as a \"sepoy\" (private). A reorganisation of the army that year resulted in the 1st Brahmans becoming the 1/1st Punjab Regiment. Between 1922 and 1926, Chand exclusively played army hockey tournaments and regimental games. Chand was ultimately selected for the Indian Army team which was to tour New Zealand. The team won 18 matches, drew 2 and lost only 1, receiving praise from all spectators. Following this, in the two Test matches against the New Zealand squad, the team won the first and narrowly lost the second. Returning to India, Chand was promoted to Lance Naik in 1927.\n\nAfter successfully lobbying for reintroducing field hockey in the Olympics, the newly formed Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) made preparations to send its best possible team for the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics. In 1925, an Inter-Provincial Tournament was held to select the team members. Five teams participated in the inaugural nationals – United Provinces (UP), Punjab, Bengal, Rajputana and Central Provinces. Chand got permission from the Army to play for the United Provinces team.\n\nIn its first game in the tournament, Dhyan Chand as the centre-forward, and Marthins, their inside-right, performed very well together. Chand attracted much attention by his clever stick-work. His penetrating runs and judicious passes seemed to assure for him a position in the team that is to take part in the Olympic Games. Early in the game, it became evident that Chand was at his best. In combination with Marthins he took the ball away to the right and Marthins did well to give him a good pass. Quick as lightning, Dhyan Chand shot a goal. The ball struck one of the defenders' stick and went into the net, giving goalkeeper Collie no chance. A goal within 3 minutes of the start was more than what the most optimistic of the UP supporters could expect. At the interval, UP led by three goals to nil.\n\nOn their part, Rajputana put every ounce of their efforts to score. The UP goal had more than one narrow escape, but were the winners of a fine exhibition match (3–1).\n\nBuoyed by the success of the Tournament, it was decided that it would be held every two years. After two more trial matches between various hopefuls, the Olympic team (including Chand as center-forward) was announced and assembled in Bombay. Center-half Broome Eric Pinniger was selected as the captain. The IHF was initially low on funds since the provinces of Bombay, Madras and Burma had turned a deaf ear to their financial appeal, but they managed to scrape enough money. The Olympic team then played a match against the Bombay XI, and amazingly lost 3–2, even though Singh scored both his team's goals. With a quiet send-off, the team left for England on 10 March, to play 11 matches against local sides as well in the London Folkestone Festival in 1927, winning all. It was also said that Great Britain did not send a team in 1928 to the Amsterdam Olympics after their national team was defeated by the Indian team at Folkestone.\nThis is best cited in Kapur's book \"Romance of Hockey\" where a despatch of H. Sutherland Stark, London representative of \"Sports\", a magazine of Lahore, tells the story better than any other comment : \"For reasons it is difficult to understand the English Hockey Association have taken up a very stiff attitude towards Indian Hockey in recent years and have repeatedly been twitted about it by even their own supporters. The Editor of a leading sports newspaper described them to me as an intensely conservative body, but there seems to be something more than conservative behind their unwillingness apparently ever to meet India in a full international encounter\".\nFinally, on 24 April, the team arrived in Amsterdam to embark on a tour of the Low Countries. In all the pre-Olympic matches against local Dutch, German and Belgian teams, the Indian team won by large margins.\n\nIn the 1928 Amsterdam Summer Olympics, the Indian team was put in the division A table, with Austria, Belgium, Denmark and Switzerland . On 17 May the Indian national hockey team made its Olympic debut against Austria, winning 6–0, with Chand scoring 3 goals. The next day India defeated Belgium 9–0; however Chand only scored once. On 20 May, Denmark lost to India 5–0, with Chand netting 3. Two days later, he scored 4 goals when India defeated Switzerland 6–0 in the semi-finals.\n\nThe final match took place on 26 May, with India facing the home team of the Netherlands. The Indian team's better players Feroze Khan, Ali Shaukat and Kher Singh were on the sick list and Chand himself was ill. However, even with a skeletal side, India managed to defeat the hosts 3–0 (with Singh scoring 2), and the Indian team won its country's first Olympic gold medal. Chand was the top scorer of the tournament, with 14 goals in 5 matches. A newspaper report about India's triumph said,\nOn returning to India, the team was received by thousands of people at the Bombay harbour, compared to the three people who had seen them off.\n\nPosted in Waziristan in the North-West Frontier Province (now in Pakistan) with his new 2/14 Punjab Regiment, Chand, by now a \"naik\" (corporal) was cut off from the IHF, which was by now controlled by civilians. The Inter-Provincial Tournament was being held to select the new Olympic team; the IHF wrote to the Army Sports Control Board to grant Singh leaves to participate in the nationals. His platoon refused. Chand received news that he had been selected by the IHF for the Olympic team without any formalities. The rest of his teammates however, had to prove their skills in the Inter-Provincial Tournament, which was won by Punjab. As such, seven players from Punjab were selected for the Olympic team. Apart from Chand, Broome Eric Pinnigar, Leslie Hammond and Richard Allen were the other 1928 Olympians retained in the team. Chand's brother Roop Singh was also included in the squad as a left-in. Lal Shah Bokhari was selected as captain.\n\nThe Olympic team then played practice matches in India before heading for Colombo. In two matches in Ceylon, the Olympic team beat the All Ceylon XI 20–0 and 10–0. Wrote one newspaper on the first match, \"Perfection is perilous, for it tempts the gods. For once, this was proved wrong for even the god of weather paid tribute to the genius of the Indian players. Rain clouds, which had threatened to ruin the game, vanished into the blue, and thousands of spectators spent a happy hour marveling at the incomparable artistry of the Indian team.\"\n\nThe India team set sail for San Francisco on 30 May, and arrived on 6 July. They reached Los Angeles three weeks before the opening ceremony of the Olympics, which took place on 30 July. On 4 August 1932, India played its first match against Japan and won 11–1. Chand, Roop Singh, Gurmit Singh each scored thrice, and Dickie Carr once. In the final on 11 August, India played against hosts USA. India won 24–1, a world record at that time (until it was broken in 2003), and once again clinched the gold medal. Chand scored 8 times, Roop Singh 10, Gurmit Singh 5 and Pinniger once. In fact, Chand along with his brother Roop, scored 25 out of the 35 goals scored by India. This led to them being dubbed the 'hockey twins'.\n\nOne Los Angeles newspaper wrote, \"The All-India field hockey team which G. D. Sondhi brought to Los Angeles to defend their 1928 Olympic title, was like a typhoon out of the east. They trampled under their feet and all but shoved out of the Olympic stadium the eleven players representing the United States.\"\n\nThe team then embarked on a tour of the United States. They played a match on 20 August against a United States XI, almost the same team that they had faced in Los Angeles. Even after loaning its second keeper Arthur Hind, for a half, the team won 24–1.\n\nAfter setting sail from New York, the team arrived at England. The then embarked on a hectic tour, playing nine matches in various countries in a fortnight, commencing on 2 September. They played four internationals-against the Netherlands, Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. The team then reached Sri Lanka and India, playing a number of matches to pay for their expenses. At the end of the tour, India had played 37 matches, winning 34, drawing 2, with one abandoned. Chand scored 133 of the 338 Indian goals.\n\nIn India he is often referred to as \"Hockey ka Jaadugar\" which translates to \"Magician of the game of Hockey\".\n\nIn 1933, Chand's home team, the Jhansi Heroes, he participated in and won the Beighton Cup, which he considered the most prestigious of Indian hockey tournaments. Later, he would state,\nIn Kolkata, the Heroes also won the Lakshmibilas Cup tournament, which was open only to Indian teams. In 1935, they successfully defended their Beighton Cup title, though lost the subsequent year.\n\nIn December 1934, the IHF decided to send a team to New Zealand in the new year. Chand and his brother were immediately selected. When the Nawab of Manavadar declined to play, Chand was appointed captain. In the subsequent tour, the team played a total of 48 matches on this tour, with 28 in New Zealand and the remainder in India, Ceylon and Australia. India won every match, scoring 584 goals and conceding only 40. Of these 48 matches, Chand played 23 and scored a total of 201 goals.\n\nUpon returning to India, Chand resumed his duties in the barracks. In December 1935, the IHF decided to stage the Inter-Provincial tournament to select the Olympic team. Chand was again denied permission to leave his platoon, though once again he was selected without formalities. The final team assembled in Delhi on 16 June and played against the Delhi Hockey XI. Incredibly, they lost 4–1. After this inauspicious start, the team went on a successful tour of the subcontinent, finally departing for Marseilles on 27 June. They arrived on 10 July, and after an uncomfortable journey in third-class compartments, reached Berlin on 13 July. On 17 July, the Indian team played a practice match against Germany and lost 4–1. As such, manager Pankaj Gupta informed the IHF that Ali Dara had to be sent immediately to replace the out of form Mirza Masood.\n\nOn 5 August, India won its first match against Hungary 4–0. India won the rest of the group matches against USA (7–0, with Chand scoring 2 goals) and Japan (9–0, with Chand scoring 4). On 10 August, Ali Dara arrived. Their fourth match was the semi-final against France, whom they defeated 10–0, with Chand scoring 4 goals. Meanwhile, Germany had beaten Denmark 6–0, beaten Afghanistan 4–1 and in the play-offs, had defeated the Netherlands 3–0. Thus, India and Germany were to clash in the 1936 Berlin Olympics field hockey final on 19 August.\n\nOn the morning of the final, the entire team was nervous since they had been defeated the last time they had faced Germany. In the locker room, Pankaj Gupta produced a Congress tricolour. Reverently the team saluted it, prayed and marched onto the field. The German team was successful in restricting the India side to a single goal until the first interval. After the interval, the Indian team launched an all-out attack, easily defeating Germany 8–1, incidentally the only goal scored against India in that Olympic tournament. Chand top-scored with 3 goals, Dara scored 2 and Roop Singh, Tapsell and Jaffar one each. Describing the game, the Special Correspondent of The Hindu wrote,\nThere have been many erroneous media reports over the years claiming that Dhyan Chand scored 6 goals in India's 8–1 victory over Germany in the 1936 Olympic final. In his autobiography \"Goal!\" Chand wrote:\n\n\"“When Germany was four goals down, a ball hit Allen's pad and rebounded. The Germans took full advantage of this and made a rush, netting the ball before we could stop it. That was the only goal Germany would score in the match against our eight, and incidentally the only goal scored against India in the entire Olympic tournament. India's goal-getters were Roop Singh, Tapsell and Jaffar with one each, Dara two and myself three.”\"\n\nThe International Hockey Federation records also attribute only 3 of the 8 goals to Dhyan Chand in the Berlin Olympic final. The final was included in the Leni Riefenstahl film on the 1936 Olympics, Olympia. Overall, in 3 Olympic tournaments, Chand had scored 33 goals in 12 matches.\n\nAfter returning from Berlin, Chand joined his regiment. Between 1936 and the commencement of the War in 1939, he largely confined himself to army hockey, with one visit to Kolkata to take part in the Beighton Cup tournament in 1937. Before the beighton Cup, Chand spent four months in a military camp in Pachmarhi to attend military classes. On 16 March 1938, he was made a Viceroy's Commissioned Officer (VCO; the equivalent of the present-day junior commissioned officer) with the rank of \"jemadar\" (now termed naib subedar). With the increasing need for qualified officers during wartime, he was promoted to acting \"subedar\" by July 1942 and to the war-substantive rank by early 1943. On 9 April 1943, Chand received an emergency commission as a second lieutenant in the 14th Punjab Regiment, with the war-substantive rank of lieutenant from the same date.\n\nTowards the closing phases of the war, Chand led an army hockey team which toured around the battlefields in Manipur, Burma, the Far East and Ceylon. When the war ended in 1945, Chand decided that the Indian hockey team needed new young players. In 1947, the IHF was requested by the Asian Sports Association (ASA) of East Africa to send a team to play a series of matches. The ASA made a condition that Chand should be included in the team. Once again, Chand was chosen as captain.\n\nThe team assembled in Bombay on 23 November 1947, and reached Mombasa on 15 December and played 9 matches in British East Africa winning all. Chand, though now in his forties, still managed to score 61 goals in 22 matches.\n\nAfter returning from the East African tour in early 1948, Chand decided to gradually phase out his involvement in 'serious hockey'. He played exhibition matches, leading a Rest of India side against state teams and the 1948 \"Olympic\" team which defeated Chand's side 2–1, even though an aging Chand scored his side's lone goal. Chand's last match was leading the Rest of India team against the Bengal side. The match ended in a draw after which the Bengal Hockey Association organized a public function to honor Chand's services to Indian hockey.\n\nChand continued to hold his emergency commission in the Indian Army post-Independence, with the service number IEC 3526, but was apparently not granted a regular commission. In 1951 he was honored at India's National Stadium with the inaugural Dhyan Chand Tournament, which he attended to the admiration of the spectators. \n\nAfter 34 years of service, Chand retired from the Indian Army on 29 August 1956 as a lieutenant (acting captain). The Government of India honoured him the same year by conferring him the Padma Bhushan, India's third highest civilian honour.\n\nAfter retirement, he taught at coaching camps at Mount Abu, Rajasthan. Later, he accepted the position of Chief Hockey Coach at the National Institute of Sports, Patiala, a post he held for several years. Chand spent his last days in his hometown of Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, India.\n\nChand died on 3 December 1979 from liver cancer at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi. He was cremated at the Jhansi Heroes ground in his hometown, after some initial problems in getting clearance. His regiment, the Punjab Regiment, accorded him full military honours.\n\nDhyan Chand remains a legendary figure in Indian and world hockey. His skills have been glorified in various apocryphal stories and anecdotes. A number of such these revolve around the fact that Singh had an extraordinary control over dribbling the ball. Chand's birthday, 29 August, is celebrated as National Sports Day in India. The President gives away sport-related awards such as the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna, Arjuna Award and Dronacharya Award on this day at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, India.\n\nThe 20th National Award 2012, the Gem of India, awarded by the Union Minister of India, was given to Dhyan Chand. The award was received by Dhyan Chand’s son, Ashok Dhyan Chand (a hockey Olympian in his own right) on behalf of his deceased father. The award was given by Journalist Association of India under the flagship of Journalists Federation of India, Sirifort Auditorium, New Delhi, India, on 22 September 2012.\n\nIndia's highest award for lifetime achievement in sports is the Dhyan Chand Award which has been awarded annually from 2002 to sporting figures who not only contribute through their performance but also contribute to the sport after their retirement. The National Stadium, Delhi was renamed Dhyan Chand National Stadium in 2002 in his honour.\n\nA hostel at Aligarh Muslim University, of which he was an alumnus, has been named after him.\n\nHe scored over 400 goals in his career, from 1926 to 1948.\n\nAn Astroturf hockey pitch, at the Indian Gymkhana Club in London, has been named after Indian hockey legend Dhyan Chand.\n\nGovernment of India has issued a commemorative postage stamp and a First Day Cover in honour of Dhyan Chand. He remains the only Indian hockey player to have a stamp in his honour.\n\nDhyan Chand was among the nominees considered for India's highest civilian award, Bharat Ratna, for 2014 and there was support for it. The award was then given to Sachin Tendulkar and C. N. R. Rao. The family members of Dhyan Chand were disappointed with government decision. The RTI was filed which suggested that the Prime Minister's Office had ignored the recommendation from sports ministry on giving the award over Sachin Tendulkar.\n\n\n",

    "text": "Mihály Károlyi\n\nCount Mihály Ádám György Miklós Károlyi de Nagykároly (4 March 1875 – 19 March 1955) was briefly Hungary's leader from 1918 to 1919 during the short-lived First Hungarian People's Republic. He served as Prime Minister between 1 and 16 November 1918 and as President between 16 November 1918 and 21 March 1919. \n\nThe Károlyi family were an illustrious, extremely wealthy, Roman Catholic aristocratic family who had played an important role in Hungarian life since the 17th century. Mihály was born in Fót, Austria-Hungary in what is today Hungary. In his youth, he was a wastrel, but as he grew older, he became devoted to more serious pursuits. In 1909, he became the President of the OMGE (National Agricultural Society), the main rural organization of the nobility. Initially a supporter of the existing political and social system in Hungary, Károlyi gradually became more progressive and left-wing during his career.\n\nIn 1910, Károlyi was elected to Parliament as a member of the opposition Party of Independence.\n\nIn January 1913, he was challenged to a duel by István Tisza, after refusing to shake Tisza's hand following a political disagreement. The 34-bout duel with cavalry sabres lasted an hour until Tisza cut Károlyi's arm and the seconds ended the duel.\n\nMihály Károlyi was born on March 4, 1875, in the Károlyi Palace in the aristocratic palace district of Pest. Károlyi, born of a cousin's marriage, thus born with a severe malformation: Cleft lip and cleft palate, and his illness deeply determined his entire childhood and personality development. Her mother died early in Tuberculosis and her father soon remarried. Mihály was considered unsuitable for a more serious career by his father, because he was incapable of normal speech training. Mihály was raised with great devotion by his maternal grandmother.\n\nHe was raised with overcare with his older sister in the Castle of his grandmother at Fót, because Count Julius Károlyi, the politician father had not enough time for Mihály. At the age of 14, his grandmother sent him to a Viennese clinic and he underwent a special surgery to restore his palate and mouth. [7] The surgery proved to be a sharp turning point: After some weeks Mihály started to speak quickly, fluently and very elaborately, despite the family and relatives formerly thought that he is too dumb to speak. By this time, he was a relatively superficial aristocrat, but his knowledge and awareness was below that of his contemporaries. He was not interested in university lectures, he managed to pass his exams with the help of a tutor. His thinking and character were shaped by extracurricular influences: the traditional hatred towards the Habsburg dynasty of his family, his foster father, the world-view of Sándor Károlyi in the 1848 revolution, his idea of organizing peasants into farming cooperatives. Based on his reading experiences, including the French Encyclopédie and Verne novels, he developed an idealistic devotion to the cause of world justice, unbroken faith in the fast development of science and technology. He obtained his law degree and, at the age of 24, became a rampant adult. He wanted to make up for what he had missed as a teenager, throwing himself into the nightlife, with striking vehemence; he spent his time ruthlessly, playing cards, having fun in hunting, living in French spa towns, attended many international horse races and early automobile racings in various European countries. Known for his card battles, his lone card losses and his \"dandy\" lifestyle, the young tycoon begins to get serious and turn to politics and public life.\n\nDuring the First World War, the pro-Entente Károlyi led a small but very active pacifist anti-war maverick fraction in the Hungarian parliament. Károlyi made contact with British and French Entente diplomats behind the scenes in Switzerland during the war. The Károlyi Party was always a weak group with no mass organization and only 20 members in Parliament, most of whom had little commitment to the party. Károlyi argued for peace with the Allies, looser ties between Austria and Hungary, abolishing the property-based franchise requirements that allowed only 5.8% of the population to vote and run for office before the war, and giving women the right to vote and hold office. In particular, Károlyi's demand in 1915 that veterans should be granted the right to vote won so much popular support that enraged the Prime Minister, Count István Tisza. In 1916 Károlyi broke off with his party, which had found his openly pro-Entente attitude to be too radical and dangerous for a war-time pacifist fraction in the parliament. Therefore Károlyi formed a new party, called the United Party of Independence and of 1848, and generally known as the Károlyi Party.\n\nIn January 1918, Károlyi proclaimed himself a follower of Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points.\n\nOn 7 November 1914 in Budapest, Károlyi married Countess Katalin Andrássy de Csíkszentkirály et Krasznahorka, with whom he had three children. Károlyi's wife was a member of one of Hungary's most powerful families, and this marriage won Károlyi the protection of his influential father-in-law.\n\nFollowing the Aster Revolution of October 1918, Károlyi became leader of the nation. On 25 October 1918 Károlyi had formed an opposition National Council. His reputation as an opponent of the much-hated war had thrust him into a role for which he was not suited. King-Emperor Charles IV designated him as Prime Minister as a part of a desperate attempt to hold Hungary on to the Habsburgs. Károlyi would have preferred to keep the monarchy and some link to Austria if possible. Only after Charles's withdrawal from government on 16 November 1918 made Károlyi proclaim the Hungarian Democratic Republic, with himself as Provisional President. On 11 January 1919 the National Council formally recognized him as President.\n\nThe Hungarian Royal Honvéd army still had more than 1,400,000 soldiers when Mihály Károlyi was announced as prime minister of Hungary. Károlyi yielded to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's demand for pacifism by ordering the disarmament of the Hungarian army. This happened under the direction of Béla Linder, minister of war in the Károlyi government. Due to the full disarmament of its army, Hungary was to remain without a national defence at a time of particular vulnerability. During the rule of Károlyi's pacifist cabinet, Hungary lost control over approx. 75% of its former pre-WW1 territories (325 411 km²) without armed resistance and was subject to foreign occupation.\n\nMilitary and political events changed rapidly and drastically after the Hungarian disarmament. On 5 November 1918, the Serbian army, with the help of the French army, crossed southern borders. On 8 November, the Czechoslovak Army crossed the northern borders, and on 13 November, the Romanian army crossed the eastern borders of the Kingdom of Hungary. On 13 November, Károlyi signed an armistice with the Allied nations in Belgrade. It limited the size of the Hungarian army to six infantry and two cavalry divisions. Demarcation lines defining the territory to remain under Hungarian control were made.\n\nThe lines would apply until definitive borders could be established. Under the terms of the armistice, Serbian and French troops advanced from the south, taking control of the Banat and Croatia. Czechoslovakia took control of Upper Hungary and Carpathian Ruthenia. Romanian forces were permitted to advance to the River Maros (Mureș) . However, on 14 November, Serbia occupied Pécs.\nMany citizens thought that Károlyi could negotiate soft peace terms with the Allies for Hungary. Károlyi headed the Provisional Government from 1 November 1918 until 16 November, when the Hungarian Democratic Republic was proclaimed. Károlyi ruled Hungary through a National Council, transformed into the government that consisted of his party in alliance with the large Hungarian Social Democratic Party and the small Civic Radical Party led by Oszkár Jászi.\n\nAt the same time, there existed various revolutionary councils, which were dominated by the Social Democrats, which were not unlike the \"Soviets\" (Councils) that existed in Russia in 1917. This situation of Dual Power gave Károlyi responsibility without much power while giving the Social Democrats power without much responsibility.\n\nDuring their brief periods in power, Károlyi and Jászi, who served as Nationalities Minister, tried to create an \"Eastern Switzerland\" by persuading the non-Magyar peoples of Hungary to stay as part of the new Hungarian Democratic Republic.\n\nAdditional trouble for the new government occurred over the question of the armistice. Austria-Hungary had signed the lenient Armistice of villa Giusti (close to Padua, Italy) with the Allies on 3 November 1918. Since Hungary was now independent, some in the Cabinet argued that Hungary needed to sign a new armistice. Against his better judgement, Károlyi agreed to this idea, and had Hungary sign in November 1918, a new armistice with the Allies in Belgrade with the Allied Commander in the Balkans, the French General Louis Franchet d'Esperey.\n\nGeneral Franchet d'Esperey treated the Hungarians with open contempt and imposed a much harsher armistice on the defeated nation than the Padua Armistice had. This was the source of much criticism of Károlyi, who had been expected – and who himself expected – the Allies to treat Hungary as a friend, not an enemy. Moreover, Károlyi's opponents argued that by needlessly seeking a second armistice, Károlyi had worsened Hungary's situation.\n\nFurthermore, the Social Democrats who were Hungary's largest party by far, frequently undercut Károlyi and imposed their decisions on him without taking responsibility for their actions. Károlyi wished to transfer almost all of the rural lands to the peasants. To set an example, he gave all of his own vast family estates to his tenants. But this was the only land transfer that took place; the Social Democrats blocked any measures that might give the control of those lands to the peasantry on the grounds that it was promoting capitalism. \n\nIn another equally unfortunate move, the pacific-minded Károlyi had abolished almost all the Hungarian armed forces in November 1918. All through the winter of 1918–19, the Romanians, the Yugoslavs and the Czechoslovaks often broke the armistice in order to seize more territory for themselves. After January 1919, Károlyi ordered the build-up of a Hungarian army and started to consider the idea of an alliance with Soviet Russia, through Károlyi was opposed to the idea of Communism in Hungary itself.\n\nIn addition, as Hungary had signed an armistice, not a peace treaty, the Allied blockade continued until such time as a peace treaty was signed. Hungary had suffered from food shortages throughout the war and deaths from starvation had become common from 1917 onwards. Furthermore, the country had been overwhelmed with refugees from Transylvania and Galicia.\n\nMaking things worse was the creation of Czechoslovakia which had cut Hungary off from supplies of German coal. Hungary which possessed little coal depended upon German coal imports. Without coal, most had to live without heat in the winter of 1918–19, and the railroad network had gradually ceased to function. The collapse of railroads in their turn caused the collapse of industry and hence mass unemployment.\n\nMaking things even worse was the economic incompetence of the government which printed more and more money, leading to massive inflation and even more impoverishment. Károlyi's failure to improve living conditions or persuade the Allies to lift the blockade led to public criticism of Károlyi.\n\nBaron Lajos Hatvany described Károlyi's leadership well when he noted \"From the discussions no decisions arose, and from the decisions – no actions. A cabinet? No, it was a debating club\". In the same vein, the British writer Harold Nicolson, who had known Károlyi during his exile in Britain, when reviewing Károlyi's memoirs in 1957 noted that: \"he had many qualities, but unfortunately lacked those for which a man is taken seriously by serious people\".\n\nSigmund Freud, the Austrian psychologist—who had known the two politicians personally—wrote about the assassination of István Tisza and the appointment of Mihály Károlyi as new prime minister of Hungary:\n\nOn 20 March 1919 the French presented the Vix Note ordering Hungarian troops further back into Hungary; it was widely assumed that the military lines would be the new frontiers. Károlyi and Prime Minister Dénes Berinkey were now in an untenable position. Although they did not want to accept this French demand, they were in no position to reject it either. On 21 March, Berinkey resigned. Károlyi then announced that only the Social Democrats could form a new government. Unknown to Károlyi, however, the Social Democrats had merged their party with the Communists led by Béla Kun. Hours after Berinkey resigned, the newly merged Hungarian Socialist Party announced Károlyi's resignation and the formation of the Hungarian Soviet Republic. At that point, Károlyi accepted the \"fait accompli\" and retired from active politics.\n\n\nOn 10 April 1919, \"Romanian troops began to invade Hungary to forestall reconquest of Transylvania. A provisional government was set up by Count Julius Karolyi (brother of Michael), Count István Bethlen, Admiral Horthy, and Archduke Joseph at Szeged (under French occupation).\"\n\nIn July 1919, Károlyi went into exile in France and during World War Two, in Britain. Throughout the Horthy era, Károlyi was in a state of official disgrace in his homeland.\n\nIn 1924, while Károlyi's wife was in the United States she came down with typhoid fever. Károlyi applied for a visa to come to the United States to visit her, but the State Department imposed a gag order, preventing him from giving any political speeches, as the State Department believed him to be a Communist. A year later, Countess Károlyi was denied a visa to visit the United States, but Secretary Kellogg of the State Department refused to explain on what grounds her visa denial was made. Morris Ernst acted as Károlyi's lawyer for these issues.\n\nIn 1946, Károlyi, who by that time had become a socialist, returned to Hungary and from 1947–49 served as the Hungarian Ambassador to France. In 1949, he resigned in protest over the show trial and execution of László Rajk.\n\nHe wrote two volumes of memoirs in exile; \"Egy egész világ ellen\" (\"Against the Entire World\") in 1925 and \"Memoirs: Faith without Illusion\" in 1954.\n\nHe died in Vence, France.\n\nIn 1975, a memorial to Károlyi, sculpted by Imre Varga, was installed in Budapest's Kossuth Lajos tér. In 2012, the government began renovation to the square to the way it looked before World War II, and Károlyi's statue was moved to Siófok. At the same time, throughout Hungary, many cities changed the name of their own streets named after Mihály Károlyi. In Budapest for example the name of the prominent street in downtown, was changed from \"Károlyi Mihály utca\" to simply \"Károlyi utca\", removing the association with him.\n\n\n",

    "text": "Maná\n\nManá (Spanish: \"manna\") is a Mexican pop rock band from Guadalajara, Jalisco. This band was formed in 1986. Maná is considered the most successful Latin American band of all time with over 40 million albums sold worldwide. The group's current line-up consists of vocalist/guitarist Fher Olvera, drummer Alex González, guitarist Sergio Vallín and bassist Juan Calleros. Maná has earned four Grammy Awards, eight Latin Grammy Awards, five MTV Video Music Awards Latin America, six Premios Juventud awards, nineteen Billboard Latin Music Awards and fifteen Premios Lo Nuestro awards. \n\nManá has topped the all-time lists in much of Latin America and in their native Mexico, where they set landmarks in record sales and concert attendances. The band formed in 1986 and released its first album, \"Falta Amor\", in 1990. In 1992, the group released \"¿Dónde Jugarán Los Niños?\", which sold more than 10 million copies worldwide, (over 700,000 copies in the US alone) becoming the best selling Spanish-language rock album of all time. After several lineup changes, the group released \"Cuando los Ángeles Lloran\" (1995), which is noted for its stylistic departure from the band's previous work. Maná followed with \"Sueños Líquidos\" (1997), \"Revolución de Amor\" (2002), and \"Amar es Combatir\" (2006), which continued the group's success. The band followed up with \"Drama y Luz\" in April 2011. Their most recent album is \"Cama Incendiada\", which was released in early 2015.\n\nThe band's sound draws from pop rock, progressive rock, Latin pop, calypso, reggae and ska music genres. They initially received international commercial success in Latin America and Spain and have since gained popularity and exposure in the US and around the world.\n\nManá was formed in 1986 by José Fernando \"Fher\" Olvera (vocals), Ulises (guitars) and Juan Calleros (bass guitar), who had been performing together in a band called Sombrero Verde since the mid-1970s and disbanded in 1983. The three placed an advertisement in the local Guadalajara newspaper looking for a drummer to complete a new band, to which fifteen-year-old Alex González applied and soon joined the group. Maná's first album was titled \"Maná released on May 12, 1987 on A& M Records. Maná signed to PolyGram, but became unhappy with the direction the label was taking the band and switched to Warner Music shortly before the release of the group's 2nd album, \"Falta Amor\". A year passed before the album garnered its first hit single, \"Rayando el Sol\". The group toured heavily in support of the album performing more than 250 times throughout Latin America, including shows in Mexico, Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia.\n\nIn 1991, they added two new members to the group, Iván González on keyboards and César \"Vampiro\" López on guitar. Ulises Calleros no longer performed with the group, but became one of their managers. On 27 October 1992, the band released \"¿Dónde Jugarán Los Niños?\", an album that spawned several hits (including \"Vivir Sin Aire,\" \"Oye Mi Amor,\" and \"De Pies a Cabeza\"). The record sold over 3 million copies worldwide and became the best selling Spanish-language rock album of all time. The band undertook an international tour with 268 concerts in 17 countries.\n\nIn 1994, López and Iván González left the group due to musical and personal disputes. Fher Olvera and Alex González felt that their departure offered an opportunity to reinvent the group's sound, and searched throughout Mexico, Spain and Argentina to find a new guitarist. In the meantime, Maná released the live album \"Maná en Vivo\" before choosing Mexican guitarist Sergio Vallín to replace Calleros and López. In 1995, the band recorded a Spanish version of Led Zeppelin's \"Fool in the Rain\" for the tribute album \"\".\nOn 25 April 1995, the group released \"Cuando los Ángeles Lloran\". The album was noted for its stylistic departure from the band's previous work, which saw the group experimenting with funk and soul music genres. Olvera explained shortly after the release of the album, \"Basically, we're still the same Maná, but we're going through a funky, soulish stage. We want to have some fun and be a little louder.\" The initial reaction to \"Cuando los Ángeles Lloran\" was mixed and the first single, the funk-influenced \"Déjame Entrar\", failed to reach the top ten on the Mexican Singles Chart. However, the album later caught on and sold 500,000 copies in the United States alone within five months of release.\n\nIn 1997, the group released \"Sueños Líquidos\", an album about the highs and lows of love, with songs like \"Clavado en un bar\" and \"En el Muelle de San Blás,\" recorded in Puerto Vallarta and released simultaneously in 36 countries. The recording received a Grammy Award as Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album. The group performed acoustically in Miami for Latin America's \"MTV Unplugged\" program. A final version of the performance was mixed at Conway Recording Studios in Hollywood, and the band released \"Maná MTV Unplugged\" on 22 June 1999. In the summer of 1999, the band co-headlined an 18-city tour of the United States with Carlos Santana. Maná also appeared on Santana's 1999 album \"Supernatural\" on the song \"Corazón Espinado\".\n\nIn 2002, in an effort to blend their sound with that of rock and roll from the sixties and seventies, the band recorded \"Revolución de Amor\". They won their fourth Grammy for the album. The band released a new version of \"Eres mi Religión\" for the Italian market in 2003, as a duet with Italian musician Zucchero, and also performed with Zucchero in a new recording of his \"Baila Morena\". This same year they participated in the annual Pavarotti & Friends concert, along with Queen, Deep Purple, Ricky Martin, Andrea Bocelli, Zucchero and Bono.\nIn 2006, after a four-year hiatus, they released their seventh studio album, \"Amar es Combatir\". It reached #4 on the \"Billboard\" Top 200 in its first week, selling over 60,000 copies in the first week. Their first single off the album, \"Labios Compartidos\", rose to the top of the music charts upon its debut in July, when the group played the song live at the Premios Juventud. \"Amar es Combatir\" has sold over 644,000 copies, and the Amar es Combatir Tour in promotion of the album grossed more than $35 million. In 2008, Maná released a live album entitled \"Arde El Cielo\", in both a CD and CD/DVD package. This release shows the band performing during the Amar es Combatir Tour in support of \"Amar es Combatir\".\n\nOn 12 April 2011, the band released its eighth studio album, \"Drama y Luz\". The record's release was delayed several times, initially scheduled for a Fall 2010 release, which was later changed to December 2010, and finally changed to April 2011. The band explained that \"Drama y Luz\" was not ready for fans and spent time during the delays putting the finishing touches on the record. Themes addressed on the album include love, hope, addiction, and racism. The first single from the album, \"Lluvia al Corazón\", became the band's sixth song to reach number one on the \"Billboard\" Latin Songs chart, as well as its eighth song to top the magazine's Latin Pop Songs chart.\n\nIn 2016, Maná was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nIn 2018, Mana received the Billboard Latin Music Lifetime Achievement Award and performed live on Telemundo from the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas. Mana was honored as the Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year on November 14, 2018. \n\nIn 2019 , Mana announced on February 2019 their new tour \"Rayando el sol tour\" that will start in the USA on September 2019. In April 12th Maná released a new version of their classic hit Rayando el sol featuring Spanish singer Pablo Alborán as the first song from their upcoming project.\n\nSelva Negra Foundation (\"Black Jungle Foundation\") is a foundation formed by Maná in 1995. Under the direction of Mari González and Augusto Benavides, they finance and support important projects aimed at protecting the environment. With the support of Mexico's government, they also have efforts to save the sea turtle by raising 140,000 turtle eggs for release on the country's Pacific coast. On April 7, 2008, Maná and the Selva Negra Foundation were named \"Champions of Health\" by the Pan American Health Organization during an observance of World Health Day 2008 at PAHO headquarters in Washington, D.C.\n\nManá supported U.S. President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection bid.\n\nOn 29 March 2007, Puerto Rico's Channel 4, WAPA's News program, reported that Maná publicly supported Puerto Rico's prospective independence from the United States. In an interview that followed the aforementioned news announcement, the members of Maná were interviewed by Channel 4 (WAPA) journalist, Rafael Lenín López, who asked them what they thought about Puerto Rico. Maná members confirmed that they support the Puerto Rican Independence Movement and favor greater sovereignty for the Latin American and Caribbean island-nation.\n\nVarious of their songs have political inspirations. The liner notes for \"Me Voy a Convertir en Un Ave,\" on the album \"Sueños Líquidos\", for example, notes that the song is \"inspired by the book \"Pedro y el capitán\" by Mario Benedetti and dedicated to all those who, for defending an ideal of justice, are persecuted or find themselves imprisoned. To the Zapatista Army of National Liberation communities for peace and dignity.\"\n\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations that leads international efforts to defeat hunger. FAO was founded on October 16, 1945 in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. The FAO Goodwill Ambassadors Programme was initiated in 1999. Maná was nominated and appointed FAO Ambassadors on October 16, 2003. Maná emphasized that their song \"Justicia, Tierra y Libertad\" (in English: Justice, Land and liberty [freedom]) from the \"Revolución de Amor\" album, is a message of hope and inspiration in the search of a world without hunger; the song also appears in a Chevrolet commercial.\n\nThe group is donating a portion of the ticket office collections to the FAO during its recent tour of the United States. They will continue designating part of their gains to this organization during the rest of the tour of the United States, Mexico and Europe.\n\nOfficial members:\nLive band members:\n\nFormer members:\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It is south of the center of Warner Robins and is part of the Warner Robins Metropolitan Statistical Area. Bonaire is located on and around U.S. Route 129/Georgia State Route 247, which is connected to Interstate 75 by Georgia State Route 96. Bonaire is the hometown of former state Governor and 31st United States Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue.\n\nThe inhabitants of the area formed Bonaire around the newly laid Georgia Southern & Florida railway when it came through in 1888. Newspaper records in 1888 uniformly spell it without the final \"e\", but in 1889 the modern spelling began to be used (perhaps because the post office was registered with that spelling on Dec 3, 1888). The name is reputedly of French origin, meaning \"good air\". The Georgia General Assembly incorporated Bonaire in 1912.

    "text": "Simile (computer virus)\n\nWin32/Simile (also known as Etap and MetaPHOR) is a metamorphic computer virus written in assembly language for Microsoft Windows. The virus was released in the most recent version in early March 2002. It was written by the virus writer \"Mental Driller\". Some of his previous viruses, such as Win95/Drill (which used the TUAREG polymorphic engine), have proved very challenging to detect.\n\nWhen the virus is first executed, it checks the current date. If the host file (the file that is infected with the virus) imports the file User32.dll, then on the 17th of March, June, September, or December, a message is displayed. Depending on the version of the virus, the case of each letter in the text is altered randomly. On May 14 (the anniversary of Israeli independence day), a message saying \"Free Palestine!\" will be displayed if the system locale is set to Hebrew.\n\nThe virus then rebuilds itself. This metamorphic process is very complex and accounts for around 90% of the virus' code. After the rebuild, the virus searches for executable files in folders on all fixed and remote drives. Files will not be infected if they are located in a subfolder more than three levels deep, or if the folder name begins with the letter W. For each file that is found, there is a 50 percent chance that it will be ignored. Files will not be infected if they begin with F, PA, SC, DR, NO, or if the letter V appears anywhere in the file name. Due to the way in which the name matching is done, file names that contain certain other characters are also not infected, although this part is not deliberate. The virus contains checks to avoid infecting \"goat\" or \"bait\" files (files that are created by anti-virus programs). The infection process uses the structure of the host, as well as random factors, to control the placement of the virus body and the decryptor.\n\n\n",

The tracks were sequenced by Kravitz's engineer, Henry Hirsch.\n\nThe album reached number 2 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and number 12 on the UK Albums Chart.\n\nThis album has been released with the Copy Control protection system in some regions.\n\n\"Again\" was released as the promotional single for this compilation, along with a music video. The single reached number four on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, becoming Kravitz's highest-charting song since \"It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over\".\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented \"Lenny Kravitz's greatest gift is that he's a master synthesist, pulling together different sounds and styles from eras past to create a sound that isn't necessarily blazingly original, but fresh due to his craft and sheer mastery of the studio. Since he was an unabashed classicist, his records often suffered the brunt of nasty criticism, but they were often very good, particularly early in his career before he indulged in the mannerisms of guitar-blasting stadium rock... After all, it doesn't just have all the main songs, it also illustrates that he indeed is a master synthesist.\n\nThe Japan release has the song \"Is There Any Love In Your Heart\" appended as track 12. The tracks otherwise remained the same.\n\nOn November 8, 2005, the album was re-released due to Kravitz's 2005 tour, including the songs \"Dig In\" and \"Where Are We Runnin'?\", from his latest albums, \"Lenny\" and \"Baptism\" respectively.\n\nDVD\n\n!scope=\"row\"|Worldwide (IFPI)\n",

About 400 undergraduate and graduate students are enrolled at the school which also includes a Pre-College Division for young musicians. \n\nThe San Francisco Conservatory of Music was founded in 1917 by Ada Clement and Lillian Hodghead as the Ada Clement Piano School. Its first location was the home of Lillian's parents, at 3435 Sacramento Street. The school opened with three pianos, four studios, two blackboards and 40 students.\n\nThe Ada Clement Piano School quickly expanded. Several years after its founding, the name changed to the Ada Clement Music School, and then in 1923 to the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. In 1956 the Conservatory moved from Sacramento Street to 1201 Ortega Street, the home of a former infant shelter. It resided there for fifty years, before moving to its current location at 50 Oak Street in 2006.\n\n\nSan Francisco Conservatory of Music offers music education in addition to community enrichment programs and performances. In 2018, celebrating its 100th anniversary it announced a donation of $46.4 million from the William K. Bowes, Jr. Foundation. The funding was to be used to construct a 12-floor building containing two concert halls in the city's Civic Center area.\n\n\n\n",

Groot Marico is named after the Marico River.\n\nThe topography comprises dry bushveld with a climate that is ideal for cattle, maize, citrus fruit and tobacco. Open pit quarries in the area extract marble, slate and andalusite, with prospects of large-scale nickel mining on the banks of the Groot Marico river as well as the majority of the farms surrounding the hamlet having sparked a successful regional petition against such development. In 2016 a new diamond prospecting application was initiated, bringing a new round of local community objections and petitioning.\n\nThe town was formed by the Voortrekkers in the 1850s and was only proclaimed in 1948.\n\nThe word \"Marico\" was made famous in South Africa by Herman Charles Bosman's writings of this area and later re-enactments of these tales by actor Patrick Mynhardt. Bosman described the area thus: \n\nAt least part of Bosman's musings may have been inspired by sips of the mampoer for which Groot Marico is infamous.\n\nIn 2010, the farms surrounding Groot Marico were among the last in South Africa to still be connected through party lines to a manual telephone exchange, which require callers to ask an operator to connect them to other telephone lines by pushing jacks into slots.\n\nGroot Marico is the smallest town in South Africa that host an annual arts festival as well as a mountain bike race.\n",

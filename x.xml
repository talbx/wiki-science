[[Latin]]: Alcumena means "strong in wrath"&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Graves]]. ''[[The Greek Myths]] (1960)''&lt;/ref&gt;) was
the wife of [[Amphitryon]] by whom she bore two children, [[Iphicles]] and [[Laonome]]. She is better known as the
mother of [[Heracles]] whose father was the god [[Zeus]]. Alcmene was also called '''Electryone''' (&#7976;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#961;&#965;&#974;&#957;&#951;&#957;),
a patronymic name as a daughter of [[Electryon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Shield of Heracles]]'' 16&lt;/ref&gt; ==
Mythology == ===Background=== According to the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'', Alcmene was born to
[[Electryon]], the son of [[Perseus]] and [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]], and king of [[Tiryns]] and [[Mycenae]] or
Medea in [[Argolis (ancient region)|Argolis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece''
[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D25%3Asection%3D9

and [[Astydameia|Astydamia]].&lt;ref name="Apollod. 2.4.5"&gt;Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheca
(Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Library]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.4.5 2.4.5]&lt;/ref&gt; Other
accounts say her mother was [[Lysidice (mythology)|Lysidice]], the daughter of [[Pelops]] and [[Hippodamia
(mythology)|Hippodameia]],&lt;ref name="Plut. Thes. 7.1"&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''[[Parallel Lives|Lives]]'' Theseus

daughter of [[Pelops]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Library of History''
[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html 4.9].&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Pausanias
(geographer)|Pausanias]], the poet [[Asius of Samos|Asius]] made Alcmene the daughter of [[Amphiaraus]] and
[[Eriphyle]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece''
[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+5.17.8 5.17.8].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hesiod]] describes Alcmene as the
tallest, most beautiful woman with wisdom surpassed by no person born of mortal parents. It is said that her face and
dark eyes were as charming as [[Aphrodite]]'s, and that she honoured her husband like no woman before her.&lt;ref
name="Hes. Sh. 1"&gt;Hesiod, ''Shield of Heracles'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Sh.+1 1 ff.]&lt;/ref&gt;
===Exile to Thebes=== According to the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'', Alcmene went with
[[Amphitryon]] to [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]], where he was purified by [[Creon]] for accidentally killing
[[Electryon]]. Alcmene refused to marry Amphitryon until he had avenged the death of her brothers.&lt;ref name="Apollod.
2.4.6"&gt;Apollodorus, ''Library'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.4.6 2.4.6]&lt;/ref&gt;
During Amphitryon's expedition against the [[Taphians]] and [[Teleboans]],&lt;ref name="Apollod. 2.4.7"&gt;Apollodorus,
''Library'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.4.7 2.4.7]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zeus]] visited Alcmene
disguised as Amphitryon. Zeus persuaded Alcmene that he was her husband. &lt;ref&gt;Roman, L., &amp; Roman, M. (2010).
{{Google books|tOgWfjNIxoMC|Encyclopedia of Greek and Roman mythology.|page=54}} &lt;/ref&gt; Extending one night into
three, Zeus slept with Alcmene, his great-granddaughter, thereby conceiving [[Heracles]], while recounting Amphitryon's
victories against the Teleboans. When Amphitryon finally returned to Thebes, Alcmene told him that he had come the night
before and slept with her; he learned from [[Tiresias]] what Zeus had done.&lt;ref name="Apollod. 2.4.8"&gt;Apollodorus,
''Library'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.4.8 2.4.8]&lt;/ref&gt; ===Birth of Heracles===
====Homer==== In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', when Alcmene was about to give birth to Heracles, Zeus announced to all the
gods that on that day a child by Zeus himself would be born and rule all those around him. [[Hera]], after requesting
Zeus to swear an oath to that effect, descended from [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] to [[Argos]] and made the wife of
[[Sthenelus (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Sthenelus]] (son of Perseus) give birth to [[Eurystheus]] after only seven
months, while at the same time preventing Alcmene from delivering Heracles. This resulted in the fulfillment of Zeus's
oath in that it was Eurystheus rather than Heracles.&lt;ref name="Hom. Il. 19.95"&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]''
[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Il.+19.95 19.95ff.]&lt;/ref&gt; ====Ovid==== According to [[Ovid]]'s
''[[Metamorphoses]]'', while in labour, Alcmene was having great difficulty giving birth to such a large child. After
seven days and nights of agony, Alcmene stretched out her arms and called upon [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]], the [[List
of Roman birth and childhood deities|goddess of childbirth]] (the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] equivalent of
[[Eileithyia]]). While Lucina did go to Alcmene, she had been previously instructed by [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] (Hera)
to prevent the delivery. With her hands clasped and legs crossed, Lucina muttered charms, thereby preventing Alcmene
from giving birth. Alcmene writhed in pain, cursed the heavens, and came close to death. [[Galanthis]], a maid of
Alcmene who was nearby, observed Lucina's behaviour and quickly deduced that it was Juno's doing. To put an end to her
mistress's suffering, she announced that Alcmene had safely delivered her child, which surprised Lucina so much that she
immediately jumped up and unclenched her hands. As soon as Lucina leapt up, Alcmene was released from her spell, and
gave birth to Heracles. As punishment for deceiving Lucina, Galanthis was transformed into a [[weasel]]; she continued
to live with Alcmene.&lt;ref name="Ov. Met. 9.273"&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]''
[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Ov.+Met.+9.273 9.273ff.]&lt;/ref&gt; ====Pausanias==== In [[Pausanias
(geographer)|Pausanias']] recounting, Hera sent witches (as they were called by the Thebans) to hinder Alcmene's
delivery of Heracles. The witches were successful in preventing the birth until [[Galanthis|Historis]], daughter of
Tiresias, thought of a trick to deceive the witches. Like Galanthis, Historis announced that Alcmene had delivered her
child; having been deceived, the witches went away, allowing Alcmene to give birth.&lt;ref name="Paus. 9.11.3"&gt;[[Pausanias
(geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+9.11.3 9.11.3]&lt;/ref&gt;
====Plautus==== In contrast to the depictions of a difficult labor above, an alternative version is presented in
''[[Amphitryon (Plautus play)|Amphitryon]]'', a comedic play by [[Plautus]]. Here Alcmene calls upon Jupiter, who
performs a miracle allowing her to give birth quickly and without pain. After a crash of thunder and light, the baby
arrives without anyone's assistance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plautus]], ''Amphitryon''
[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0092 "The Subject"]&lt;/ref&gt; ===Death=== After the
death of Amphitryon, Alcmene married [[Rhadamanthus|Rhadamanthys]], son of Zeus, and lived with him in exile at [[Ocalea
(town)|Ocaleae]] in [[Boeotia]].&lt;ref name="Apollod. 2.4.11"&gt;Apollodorus, ''Library''
[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.4.11 2.4.11]&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that after Heracles was
[[apotheosis]]ed, Hyllus, having pursued and killed [[Eurystheus]], cut off Eurystheus' head and gave it to Alcmene, who
gouged out the eyes with weaving pins.&lt;ref name="Apollod. 2.8.1"&gt;Apollodorus, ''Library''
[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.8.1 2.8.1]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Metamorphoses]], an aging Alcmene
recounted the story of the birth of Heracles to [[Iole]].&lt;ref name="Ov. Met. 9.273" /&gt; There are two accounts of
Alcmene's death. In the first, according to the Megarians, Alcmene was walking from Argos to Thebes when she died at
[[Megara]]. The [[Heracleidae]] fell into disagreement about where to take Alcmene's body, with some wishing to take her
corpse back to Argos, and others wishing to take it to Thebes to be buried with Amphitryon and Heracles' children by
[[Megara (mythology)|Megara]]. However, the god in [[Delphi]] gave the Heracleidae an oracle that it was better to bury
Alcmene in Megara.&lt;ref name="Paus. 1.41.1"&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece''
[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+1.41.1 1.41.1]&lt;/ref&gt; In the second account given by the
Thebans, when Alcmene died, she was turned from human form to a stone.&lt;ref name="Paus. 9.16.7"&gt;Pausanias,
''Description of Greece'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+9.16.7 9.16.7]&lt;/ref&gt; Pausanias
indicated that an altar to Alcmene had been built in the [[Cynosarges]] in Athens, alongside altars to Heracles, [[Hebe
(mythology)|Hebe]], and [[Iolaus]].&lt;ref name="Paus. 1.19.3"&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece''
[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+1.19.3 1.19.3]&lt;/ref&gt; Pausanias also said that Alcmene's tomb
is located near the Olympieum at Megara.&lt;ref name="Paus. 1.41.1" /&gt; ==Notes== {{Commons category|Alcmene}}

    <ns0:text xml:space="preserve">'''Alcidamas''' ({{lang-grc-gre|&#7944;&#955;&#954;&#953;&#948;&#940;&#956;&#945;&#962;}}), of [[Elaea (Aeolis)|Elaea]], in [[Aeolis]], [[ancient Greece|Greek]] [[sophist]] and [[rhetoric]]ian, flourished in the 4th century BC.  ==Life== He was the pupil and successor of [[Gorgias]] and taught at [[Athens]] at the same time as [[Isocrates]], to whom he was a rival and opponent. We possess two declamations under his name: ''On Sophists'' (&#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#931;&#959;&#966;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8182;&#957;), directed against Isocrates and setting forth the superiority of extempore over written speeches (a more recently discovered fragment of another speech against Isocrates {{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} is probably of later date); ''Odysseus'' (perhaps spurious)&lt;ref&gt;O'Sullivan 2008&lt;/ref&gt; in which [[Odysseus]] accuses [[Palamedes (mythology)|Palamedes]] of treachery during the siege of [[Troy]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}  According to Alcidamas, the highest aim of the orator was the power of speaking ''extempore'' on every conceivable subject. [[Aristotle]] (''Rhet.'' iii. 3) criticizes his writings as characterized by pomposity of style and an extravagant use of poetical epithets and compounds and far-fetched metaphors.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}  Of other works only fragments and the titles have survived: ''Messeniakos'', advocating the freedom of the [[Messenia (ancient region)|Messenians]] and containing the sentiment that "God has left all men free; nature has made no man a slave";&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhet.]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0060%3Abekker+page%3D1373b 1373b] 18&#8211;19 with the scholium of the anonymous commentator (''[[Commentaria in Aristotelem Graeca|CAG]]'' XXI:2, p. 74.31f.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Bury and Russell Meiggs, ''A History of Greece to the Death of Alexander the Great'', fourth ed. (New York, New York:  St. Martin's Press, 1975), page 375.&lt;/ref&gt; a ''Eulogy of Death'', in consideration of the wide extent of human sufferings; a ''Techne'' or instruction-book in the art of rhetoric; and a ''Phusikos logos''. Lastly, his ''Mouseion'' (a word invoking the [[Muse]]s) seems to have contained the narrative of the ''[[Contest of Homer and Hesiod]]'',  of which the version that has survived  is the work of a grammarian in the time of [[Hadrian]], based on Alcidamas.

We possess two declamations under his name: ''On Sophists'' (&#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#931;&#959;&#966;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8182;&#957;), directed against Isocrates and setting forth the superiority of extempore over written speeches (a more recently discovered fragment of another speech against Isocrates {{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} is probably of later date); ''Odysseus'' (perhaps spurious)&lt;ref&gt;O'Sullivan 2008&lt;/ref&gt; in which [[Odysseus]] accuses [[Palamedes (mythology)|Palamedes]] of treachery during the siege of [[Troy]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}  According to Alcidamas, the highest aim of the orator was the power of speaking ''extempore'' on every conceivable subject. [[Aristotle]] (''Rhet.'' iii. 3) criticizes his writings as characterized by pomposity of style and an extravagant use of poetical epithets and compounds and far-fetched metaphors.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}  Of other works only fragments and the titles have survived: ''Messeniakos'', advocating the freedom of the [[Messenia (ancient region)|Messenians]] and containing the sentiment that "God has left all men free; nature has made no man a slave";&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhet.]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0060%3Abekker+page%3D1373b 1373b] 18&#8211;19 with the scholium of the anonymous commentator (''[[Commentaria in Aristotelem Graeca|CAG]]'' XXI:2, p. 74.31f.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Bury and Russell Meiggs, ''A History of Greece to the Death of Alexander the Great'', fourth ed. (New York, New York:  St. Martin's Press, 1975), page 375.&lt;/ref&gt; a ''Eulogy of Death'', in consideration of the wide extent of human sufferings; a ''Techne'' or instruction-book in the art of rhetoric; and a ''Phusikos logos''. Lastly, his ''Mouseion'' (a word invoking the [[Muse]]s) seems to have contained the narrative of the ''[[Contest of Homer and Hesiod]]'',  of which the version that has survived  is the work of a grammarian in the time of [[Hadrian]], based on Alcidamas.

Aldine Vergil of 1501, the first of the standard octavo Aldines|thumb]] '''Aldine Press''' was the [[printing]] office
started by [[Aldus Manutius]] in 1494 in [[Venice]], from which were issued the celebrated Aldine editions of the
classics (Latin and Greek masterpieces plus a few more modern works). The first book that was dated and printed under
his name appeared in 1495.&lt;ref name="Aldus and His Dream Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barolini|first1=Helen|title=Aldus
and His Dream Book|date=1992|publisher=Italica Press, Inc.|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-934977-22-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Aldine Press is famous in the history of [[typography]], among other things, for the introduction of [[italics]].&lt;ref

first to issue printed books in the small [[octavo (book)|octavo]] size, similar to that of a modern paperback, and like
that intended for portability and ease of reading.&lt;ref name="Aldus and His Dream Book" /&gt;{{rp|82-84}} According to
Curt Buhler, the press issued 132 books during twenty years of activity under Aldus.&lt;ref name="Aldus and His Dream
Book" /&gt; After Aldus&#8217; death in 1515 the press was continued by his wife, Maria and her father, Andrea
Torresani, until his son, Paulus Manutius (1512&#8211;1574) took over. His grandson [[Aldus Manutius the Younger]] then
ran the firm until his death in 1597. Today, the antique books printed by the Aldine Press in Venice are referred to as
''Aldines''.&lt;ref name="The First Five Hundred Years"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=B&#252;hler|first1=Curt F.|title=Aldus

patent|monopoly]] of works printed in Greek in the Republic of Venice, effectively giving it copyright protection.
Protection outside the Republic was more problematic, however. The firm maintained an agency in Paris, but its
commercial success was affected by many counterfeit editions, produced in Lyons and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="A
Bibliographical Sketch of the Aldine Press at Venice" /&gt; ==Beginnings== [[File:Title page of Herodotus' history of
the Greek and Persian Wars 1502.jpg|thumb|right|[[Italian language|Italian]] translation of [[Herodotus' Histories]] by
Count [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]], published in [[Venice]], Aldine Press in 1502 (1533?).]] [[Aldus Manutius]], the founder
of the Aldine Press, was originally a humanist scholar and teacher. Manutius met Andrea Torresani, who had acquired
publishing equipment from [[Nicolas Jenson|Nicholas Jensen]]'s widow. The Aldine Press was originally owned half by Pier
Francesco Barbarigo, the nephew of the current doge of the time, [[Agostino Barbarigo]], and the other half by Andrea
Torresani. Manutius owned one fifth of Torresani's share. Manutius mainly was in charge of the scholarship and editing,
leaving financial and operating concerns to Barbarigo and Torresani. In 1496, Aldus established his own location in a
building called the ''Thermae'' in the [[San Polo|Sestiere di San Polo]]. The building was later demolished in 1873.
Manutius lived and worked in the ''Thermae'' to produce published books from the Aldine Press. This was also the
location of the "New Academy", where a group of Manutius' friends, associates, and editors came together to translate
Greek and Latin texts.&lt;ref name="New Aldine Studies"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fletcher III|first1=Harry George|title=New
Aldine Studies|date=1988|publisher=Bernard M. Rosenthal, Inc.|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-9600094-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1-5}}
==Accomplishments of the Aldine Press== The press was started by Manutius based on his love of classics and the need of
preservation of Hellenic studies. At first the press printed new copies of Plato, Aristotle, and other Greek and Latin
classics. Manutius also printed dictionaries and grammars to help people interpret the books, used by scholars wanting
to learn Greek to employ learned Greeks to teach them directly.&lt;ref name="The Printing Press as an Agent of Change"&gt;{{cite
book|last1=Eisenstein|first1=Elizabeth L.|title=The Printing Press as an Agent of
Change|url=https://archive.org/details/printingpressas01eise|url-access=registration|date=1979|publisher=Cambridge
University Press|location=Cambridge, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Elizabeth Eisenstein]] claimed that the fall of
[[Constantinople]] in 1453 had threatened the importance and survival of Greek scholarship, but publications such as
those by the Aldine Press secured it. [[Erasmus]] was one of the scholars learned in Greek with whom the Aldine Press
partnered in order to provide accurately translated text.&lt;ref name="The Printing Press as an Agent of Change" /&gt;{{rp|221}}
The Aldine Press also expanded into current languages, mainly Italian and French.&lt;ref name="New Aldine Studies" /&gt;[[File:Aldus
Manutius LOC photo meetup 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Aldus Manutius LOC photo meetup 2012]] ===Humanist typefaces=== Aldus
Manutius hired [[Francesco Griffo]] to create a typeface designed to reproduce the written hand of the humanists. This
resulted in the first roman face adapted and known today as [[italic type]]. It was first used to print [[Pietro
Bembo|Cardinal Pietro Bembo's]] ''De Aetna'' in 1495. Before this time print publishing used block letters, the look of
handwriting as print was a new phenomenon and, try as he might to prevent it, Manutius' typeface was illegally copied,
spreading through Europe.&lt;ref name="The Evolution of Type" /&gt; ===Aldus Manutius the Elder's portable books=== In
1505 Manutius produced plain texts in useful form, using the term ''[[enchiridion]]'', meaning a manual or small,
hand-held weapon.&lt;ref name="New Aldine Studies" /&gt; The [[octavo]] was the first appearance of the editio minor, a
straightforward text, established as well as the editor can manage. Although these new, portable books were not cheap,
the books of the Aldine Press did not force upon their buyers a substantial investment that large volumes of text and
commentary demanded during this era. The editio minor, instead, brought financial and logistical benefits to those
interested in the classics. An individual didn't have to go to the book, rather now the book came along with them.&lt;ref
name="New Aldine Studies" /&gt;{{rp|1-7}} ===Imprint and motto=== In 1501, Aldus used as his publisher's device the
image of a [[dolphin]] wrapped around an [[anchor]].&lt;ref&gt;H. George Fletcher, ''In praise of Aldus Manutius'' (New
York: Morgan Library, 1995), pp. 26&#8211;27.&lt;/ref&gt; "The dolphin and anchor device owed its origins most
immediately to Pietro Bembo. Aldus was to tell Erasmus six years later that Bembo had given him a silver coin minted
under the Emperor Vesparian and bearing an image of this device"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite
book|last1=Mortimer|first1=Ruth|title=Catalogue of books and Manuscripts. Part II. Italian 16th Century Books. 2
vols.|date=1974|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image of the
dolphin and anchor on the coin came with a saying, "Festina Lente", meaning "make haste slowly". This would become the
motto for the Aldine Press.&lt;ref name="New Aldine Studies" /&gt; ==The Aldine Press after 1515== [[Aldus Manutius]]
the Elder died on February 6, 1515. After his death the firm was run by Andrea Torresani and his daughter, Maria, the
widow of Aldus Manutius. The Aldine Press was named in 1508 as "In the House of Aldus and Andrea Torresano" which kept
this name until 1529. In 1533, [[Paulus Manutius]] managed the firm, starting it up again and changing its name to
"Heirs of Aldus and Andrea Torresano". In 1539 the imprint changed to "Sons of Aldo Manuzio". In 1567 [[Aldus Manutius
the Younger]] continued the business until his death.&lt;ref name="A Bibliographical Sketch of the Aldine Press at

[[Abbot]] of [[Tavistock Abbey]] in around 1027. In 1046 he was named to the Bishopric of Worcester. Ealdred, besides
his episcopal duties, served [[Edward the Confessor]], the King of England, as a diplomat and as a military leader. He
worked to bring one of the king's relatives, [[Edward the Exile]], back to England from Hungary to secure an heir for
the childless king. In 1058 he undertook a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, the first bishop from England to do so.&lt;ref
name=Edward208&gt;Barlow ''Edward the Confessor'' pp. 208&#8211;209&lt;/ref&gt; As administrator of the [[Diocese of
Hereford]], he was involved in fighting against the Welsh, suffering two defeats at the hands of raiders before securing
a settlement with [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn]], a Welsh ruler. In 1060, Ealdred was elected to the archbishopric of York,
but had difficulty in obtaining papal approval for his appointment, only managing to do so when he promised not to hold
the bishoprics of York and Worcester simultaneously. He helped secure the election of [[Wulfstan (Bishop of
Worcester)|Wulfstan]] as his successor at Worcester. During his archiepiscopate, he built and embellished churches in
his diocese, and worked to improve his clergy by holding a synod which published regulations for the priesthood. Some
sources state that following King Edward the Confessor's death in 1066, it was Ealdred who crowned [[Harold Godwinson]]
as King of England.&lt;ref name=Hindley335&gt;Hindley ''Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; Ealdred
supported Harold as king, but when Harold was defeated at the [[Battle of Hastings]], Ealdred backed [[Edgar the &#198;theling]]
and then endorsed King [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]], the [[Duke of Normandy]] and a distant relative
of King Edward's. Ealdred crowned King William on Christmas Day in 1066. William never quite trusted Ealdred or the
other English leaders, and Ealdred had to accompany William back to Normandy in 1067, but he had returned to York by the
time of his death in 1069. Ealdred supported the churches and monasteries in his diocese with gifts and building
projects. ==Early life== Ealdred was probably born in the west of England, and could be related to [[Lyfing of
Winchester|Lyfing]], his predecessor as bishop of Worcester.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Lawson "Ealdred" ''Oxford Dictionary of
National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; His family, from Devonshire, may have been well-to-do.&lt;ref name=King124&gt;King
"Ealdred" ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Another relative was Wilstan or Wulfstan, who under
Ealdred's influence became [[Abbot of Gloucester]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Ealdred was a monk in the [[cathedral chapter]]
at [[Winchester Cathedral]] before becoming abbot of Tavistock Abbey about 1027, an office he held until about 1043.&lt;ref
name=Knowles72&gt;Knowles ''Monastic Order in England'' p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; Even after leaving the abbacy of Tavistock, he
continued to hold two properties from the abbey until his death.&lt;ref name=King124/&gt; No contemporary documents
relating to Ealdred's time as abbot have been discovered.&lt;ref name=King125&gt;King "Ealdred" ''Anglo-Norman Studies
XVIII'' p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Ealdred was made bishop of Worcester in 1046, a position he held until his resignation in
1062.&lt;ref name=Handbook224&gt;Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; He may have acted
as [[Suffragan bishop|suffragan]], or subordinate bishop, to his predecessor Lyfing before formally assuming the
bishopric,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Edward86&gt;Barlow ''Edward the Confessor'' p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; as from about
1043 Ealdred witnessed as an ''episcopus'', or bishop, and a charter from 1045 or early 1046 names Sihtric as abbot of
Tavistock.&lt;ref name=King125/&gt; Lyfing died on 26 March 1046, and Ealdred became bishop of Worcester shortly after.
However, Ealdred did not receive the other two dioceses that Lyfing had held, [[Bishop of Crediton|Crediton]] and
[[Bishop of Cornwall|Cornwall]]; King Edward the Confessor (reigned 1043&#8211;1066) granted these to [[Leofric
(bishop)|Leofric]], who combined the two sees at Crediton in 1050.&lt;ref name=King125/&gt; ==Bishop and royal advisor==
[[Image:Harold2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|right|Harold Godwinson, from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], whom Ealdred failed to catch
in 1051|alt=Tapestry image of a man on horseback holding a falcon]] Ealdred was an advisor to King Edward the Confessor,
and was often involved in the royal government.&lt;ref name=Huscroft49/&gt; He was also a military leader, and in 1046
he led an unsuccessful expedition against the Welsh.&lt;ref name=Huscroft49&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;
This was in retaliation for a raid led by the Welsh rulers [[Gruffydd ap Rhydderch]], [[Rhys ap Rhydderch]], and
Gruffydd ap Llywelyn. Ealdred's expedition was betrayed by some Welsh soldiers who were serving with the English, and
Ealdred was defeated.&lt;ref name=Maund89&gt;Maund ''Welsh Kings'' pp. 89&#8211;90&lt;/ref&gt; In 1050, Ealdred went to
Rome "on the king's errand",&lt;ref name=Huscroft50&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; apparently to
secure papal approval to move the seat, or centre, of the bishopric of Crediton to Exeter. It may also have been to
secure the release of the king from a vow to go on pilgrimage, if sources from after the [[Norman Conquest of England]]
are to be believed.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; While in Rome, he attended a papal council, along with his fellow English
bishop [[Herman (bishop)|Herman]].&lt;ref name=Smith574&gt;Smith, et al. "Court and Piety" ''Catholic Historical
Review'' p. 574&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, as Ealdred was returning to England he met [[Sweyn Godwinson|Sweyn]], a son
of [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex]], and probably absolved Sweyn for having abducted the abbess of [[Leominster Abbey]] in
1046.&lt;ref name=Godwins55&gt;Barlow ''Godwins'' p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Through Ealdred's intercession, Sweyn was restored
to his earldom, which he had lost after abducting the abbess and murdering his cousin [[Beorn Estrithson]].&lt;ref
name=Rex37&gt;Rex ''Harold II'' p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Edward103&gt;Barlow ''Edward the Confessor'' p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;
Ealdred helped Sweyn not only because Ealdred was a supporter of [[House of Godwin|Earl Godwin's family]] but because
Sweyn's earldom was close to his bishopric. As recently as 1049 Irish raiders had allied with Gruffydd ap Rhydderch of
[[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent]] in raiding along the [[River Usk]]. Ealdred unsuccessfully tried to drive off the raiders,
but was again routed by the Welsh. This failure underscored Ealdred's need for a strong earl in the area to protect
against raids.&lt;ref name=Mason57&gt;Mason ''House of Godwine'' pp. 57&#8211;58&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, the [[bishop of
Hereford]] would have led the defence in the absence of an Earl of Hereford, but in 1049 the incumbent, [[&#198;thelstan
(Bishop of Hereford)|&#198;thelstan]], was blind, so Ealdred took on the role of defender.&lt;ref name=King126&gt;King
"Ealdred" ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' pp. 126&#8211;127&lt;/ref&gt; ==Diplomatic travels== Earl Godwin's rebellion
against the king in 1051 came as a blow to Ealdred, who was a supporter of the earl and his family. Ealdred was present
at the royal council at London that banished Godwin's family.&lt;ref name=King127&gt;King "Ealdred" ''Anglo-Norman
Studies XVIII'' p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1051, when he was sent to intercept Harold Godwinson and his brothers as
they fled England after their father's outlawing, Ealdred "could not, or would not" capture the brothers.&lt;ref
name=Harold132&gt;Walker ''Harold'' pp. 132&#8211;133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Edward114&gt;Barlow ''Edward the
Confessor'' p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; The banishment of Ealdred's patron came shortly after the death of [[&#198;lfric
Puttoc]], the Archbishop of York. York and Worcester had long had close ties, and the two sees had often been held in
[[Benefice|plurality]], or at the same time. Ealdred probably wanted to become Archbishop of York after &#198;lfric's
death, but his patron's eclipse led to the king appointing [[Cynesige]], a royal chaplain, instead.&lt;ref name=King127/&gt;
In September 1052, though, Godwin returned from exile and his family was restored to power.&lt;ref name=Huscroft6&gt;Huscroft
''Ruling England'' pp. 6&#8211;7&lt;/ref&gt; By late 1053 Ealdred was once more in royal favour.&lt;ref name=King127/&gt;
At some point, he was alleged to have accompanied Swein on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, but proof is lacking.&lt;ref

Germany to obtain Emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]]'s help in returning [[Edward the Exile]], son of
[[Edmund Ironside]], to England. Edmund (reigned 1016) was an elder half-brother of King Edward the Confessor, and
Edmund's son Edward was in Hungary with King [[Andrew I of Hungary|Andrew I]], having left England as an infant after
his father's death and the accession of [[Canute the Great|Cnut]] as King of England.&lt;ref name=Huscroft8&gt;Huscroft
''Ruling England'' p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In this mission Ealdred was somewhat successful and obtained insight into the
working of the German church during a stay of a year&lt;ref name=Walker76&gt;Walker ''Harold'' p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; with
[[Herman II (Archbishop of Cologne)|Hermann II]], the [[Archbishop of Cologne]].&lt;ref name=Edward215&gt;Barlow
''Edward the Confessor'' pp. 215&#8211;218&lt;/ref&gt; He also was impressed with the buildings he saw, and later
incorporated some of the German styles into his own constructions.&lt;ref name=King128&gt;King "Ealdred" ''Anglo-Norman
Studies XVIII'' p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; The main objective of the mission, however, was to secure the return of Edward; but
this failed, mainly because Henry III's relations with the Hungarians were strained, and the emperor was unable or
unwilling to help Ealdred.&lt;ref name=Mason88&gt;Mason ''House of Godwine'' p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Ealdred was able to
discover that Edward was alive, and had a place at the Hungarian court.&lt;ref name=Rex126&gt;Rex ''Harold II'' p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Edward
eventually returned to England in 1057, but died shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=Rex127&gt;Rex ''Harold II'' p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Although some sources state that Ealdred attended the coronation of Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]],
this is not possible, as on the date that Henry was crowned, Ealdred was in England consecrating an abbot.&lt;ref
name=King128/&gt; Ealdred had returned to England by 1055, and brought with him a copy of the ''[[Pontificale
Romano-Germanicum]]'', a [[Roman Pontifical|set of liturgies]], with him. An extant copy of this work, currently
manuscript [[Cotton library|Cotton Vitellus E xii]], has been identified as a copy owned by Ealdred.&lt;ref
name=King128/&gt; It appears likely that the ''[[Chrodegang of Metz|Rule of Chrodegang]]'', a continental set of
ordinances for the communal life of [[Canon (priest)|secular canons]], was introduced into England by Ealdred sometime
before 1059. Probably he brought it back from Germany, possibly in concert with Harold.&lt;ref name=Rex77&gt;Rex
''Harold II'' p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; After Ealdred's return to England he took charge of the sees of Hereford&lt;ref
name=Mason94&gt;Mason ''House of Godwine'' p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bishop of Ramsbury (ancient)|Ramsbury]].&lt;ref
name=Harold132/&gt; Ealdred also administered [[Winchcombe Abbey]] and [[Gloucester Abbey]].&lt;ref name=Edward198&gt;Barlow
''Edward the Confessor'' pp. 197&#8211;199&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the ''Handbook of British Chronology Third
Edition'' say he was named bishop of Hereford in 1056, holding the see until he resigned it in 1060,&lt;ref
name=Handbook217&gt;Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; but other sources say he merely
administered the see while it was vacant,&lt;ref name=Huscroft45&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; or
that he was bishop of Hereford from 1055 to 1060.&lt;ref name=BHOYork&gt;Greenway ''Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066&#8211;1300:
Volume 6: York: Archbishops''&lt;/ref&gt; Ealdred became involved with the see of Ramsbury after its bishop [[Herman
(bishop)|Herman]] got into a dispute with King Edward over the movement of the seat of his bishopric to [[Malmesbury
Abbey]]. Herman wished to move the seat of his see, but Edward refused permission for the move. Ealdred was a close
associate of Herman's,&lt;ref name=King128/&gt; and the historian [[H. R. Loyn]] called Herman "something of an alter
ego" to Ealdred.&lt;ref name=Loyn61&gt;Loyn ''English Church'' p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; According to the medieval chronicler
[[John of Worcester]], Ealdred was given the see of Ramsbury to administer while Herman remained outside England. Herman
returned in 1058, and resumed his bishopric. There is no contemporary documentary evidence of Ealdred's administration
of Ramsbury.&lt;ref name=King128/&gt; ==Welsh affairs, Jerusalem, and Worcester== The king again employed Ealdred as a
diplomat in 1056, when he assisted earls Harold and Leofric in negotiations with the Welsh.&lt;ref name=King128a/&gt;
Edward sent Ealdred after the death in battle of Bishop [[Leofgar of Hereford]], who had attacked Gruffydd ap Llywelyn
after encouragement from the king. However, Leofgar lost the battle and his life, and Edward had to sue for peace.&lt;ref
name=Maund94&gt;Maund ''Welsh Kings'' pp. 94&#8211;95&lt;/ref&gt; Although details of the negotiations are lacking,
Gruffydd ap Llywelyn swore loyalty to King Edward,&lt;ref name=King128a/&gt; but the oath may not have had any
obligations on Gruffydd's part to Edward. The exact terms of the submission are not known in total, but Gruffydd was not
required to assist Edward in war nor attend Edward's court.&lt;ref name=Maund94/&gt; Ealdred was rewarded with the
administration of the see of Hereford, which he held until 1061, and was appointed Archbishop of York.&lt;ref
name=King128a&gt;King "Ealdred" ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' pp. 128&#8211;129&lt;/ref&gt; The diocese had suffered a
serious raid from the Welsh in 1055, and during his administration, Ealdred continued the rebuilding of the cathedral
church as well as securing the cathedral chapter's rights.&lt;ref name=King128a/&gt; Ealdred was granted the
administration in order that the area might have someone with experience with the Welsh in charge.&lt;ref
name=Darlington399/&gt; In 1058 Ealdred made a pilgrimage to [[Jerusalem]], the first English bishop to make the
journey.&lt;ref name=Edward208/&gt; He travelled through Hungary, and the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' said that "he
went to Jerusalem in such state as no-one had done before him".&lt;ref name=QKing130&gt;Quoted in King "Ealdred"
''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; While in Jerusalem he made a gift of a gold chalice to the [[church of
the Holy Sepulchre]].&lt;ref name=BarlowChurch89&gt;Barlow ''English Church 1000&#8211;1066'' p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; It is
possible that the reason Ealdred travelled through Hungary was to arrange the travel of Edward the Exile's family to
England. Another possibility is that he wished to search for other possible heirs to King Edward in Hungary.&lt;ref
name=King130&gt;King "Ealdred" ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known exactly when Edward the
Exile's family returned to England, whether they returned with Edward in 1057, or sometime later, so it is only a
possibility that they returned with Ealdred in 1058.&lt;ref name=Rex129&gt;Rex ''Harold II'' p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Very
little documentary evidence is available from Ealdred's time as Bishop of Worcester. Only five leases that he signed
survive, and all date from 1051 to 1053. Two further leases exist in ''[[Hemming's Cartulary]]'' as copies only. How the
[[Anglican Diocese of Worcester|diocese of Worcester]] was administered when Ealdred was abroad is unclear, although it
appears that [[Wulfstan (Bishop of Worcester)|Wulfstan]], the prior of the [[cathedral chapter]], performed the
religious duties in the diocese. On the financial side, the ''[[Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham|Evesham Chronicle]]''
states that [[&#198;thelwig]], who became abbot of [[Evesham Abbey]] in 1058, administered Worcester before he became
abbot.&lt;ref name=King134&gt;King "Ealdred" ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' pp. 134&#8211;137&lt;/ref&gt; ==Archbishop
of York== [[File:Bayeux Edward Funeral.jpg|left|upright=2.4|thumb|The funeral cortege of Edward the Confessor, from the
[[Bayeux Tapestry]]|alt=Tapestry image of a procession of men carrying a coffin heading towards a church building.]]
Cynesige, the archbishop of York, died on 22 December 1060, and Ealdred was elected [[Archbishop of York]] on Christmas
Day, 1060. Although a bishop was promptly appointed to Hereford, none was named to Worcester, and it appears that
Ealdred intended to retain Worcester along with York, which several of his predecessors had done.&lt;ref name=King130/&gt;
There were a few reasons for this, one of which was political, as the kings of England preferred to appoint bishops from
the south to the northern bishoprics, hoping to counter the northern tendency towards separatism. Another reason was
that York was not a wealthy see, and Worcester was. Holding Worcester along with York allowed the archbishop sufficient
revenue to support himself.&lt;ref name=Loyn158&gt;Loyn ''Governance'' p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; In 1061 Ealdred travelled to
Rome to receive the [[pallium]], the symbol of an archbishop's authority. Journeying with him was [[Tostig
Godwinson|Tostig]], another son of Earl Godwin, who was now earl of [[Northumbria]].&lt;ref name=Hindley330&gt;Hindley
''Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; William of Malmesbury says that Ealdred, by "amusing the
simplicity of King Edward and alleging the custom of his predecessors, had acquired, more by bribery than by reason, the
archbishopric of York while still holding his former see."&lt;ref name=Powell13&gt;Powell and Wallis ''House of Lords''
pp. 13&#8211;14&lt;/ref&gt; On his arrival in Rome, however, charges of [[simony]], or the buying of ecclesiastical
office, and lack of learning were brought against him, and his elevation to York was refused by [[Pope Nicholas II]],
who also deposed him from Worcester.&lt;ref name=Powell13/&gt; The story of Ealdred being deposed comes from the ''Vita
Edwardi'', a life of Edward the Confessor, but the ''Vita Wulfstani'', an account of the life of Ealdred's successor at
Worcester, [[Wulfstan (Bishop of Worcester)|Wulfstan]], says that Nicholas refused the pallium until a promise to find a
replacement for Worcester was given by Ealdred.&lt;ref name=King131&gt;King "Ealdred" ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' p.
131&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another chronicler, John of Worcester, mentions nothing of any trouble in Rome, and when discussing
the appointment of Wulfstan, says that Wulfstan was elected freely and unanimously by the clergy and people.&lt;ref
name=King131/&gt; John of Worcester also claims that at Wulfstan's consecration, [[Stigand]], the archbishop of
Canterbury extracted a promise from Ealdred that neither he nor his successors would lay claim to any jurisdiction over
the diocese of Worcester. Given that John of Worcester wrote his chronicle after the eruption of the Canterbury&#8211;York
supremacy struggle, the story of Ealdred renouncing any claims to Worcester needs to be considered suspect.&lt;ref
name=King131a&gt;King "Ealdred" ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' pp. 131&#8211;132&lt;/ref&gt; For whatever reason,
Ealdred gave up the see of Worcester in 1062, when papal legates arrived in England to hold a council and make sure
Ealdred relinquished Worcester.&lt;ref name=Harold50&gt;Walker ''Harold'' p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; This happened at Easter in
1062.&lt;ref name=Darlington399&gt;Darlington "Ecclesiastical Reform" ''English Historical Review'' pp. 399&#8211;400&lt;/ref&gt;
Ealdred was succeeded by Wulfstan, chosen by Ealdred, but John of Worcester relates that Ealdred had a hard time
deciding between Wulfstan and &#198;thelwig.&lt;ref name=Monastic76&gt;Knowles ''Monastic Order'' p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; The
legates had urged the selection of Wulfstan because of his saintliness.&lt;ref name=BarlowChurch106&gt;Barlow ''English
Church 1000&#8211;1066'' pp. 106&#8211;107&lt;/ref&gt; Because the position of Stigand, the archbishop of Canterbury,
was irregular, Wulfstan sought and received consecration as a bishop from Ealdred. Normally, Wulfstan would have gone to
the archbishop of Canterbury, as the see of Worcester was within Canterbury's province.&lt;ref name=Brooks306&gt;Brooks
''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; Although Ealdred gave up the bishopric, the appointment
of Wulfstan was one that allowed Ealdred to continue his considerable influence on the see of Worcester. Ealdred
retained a number of estates belonging to Worcester. Even after the Norman Conquest, Ealdred still controlled some
events in Worcester, and it was Ealdred, not Wulfstan, who opposed [[Urse d'Abetot]]'s attempt to extend the castle of
Worcester into the cathedral after the Norman Conquest.&lt;ref name=King132&gt;King "Ealdred" ''Anglo-Norman Studies
XVIII'' pp. 132&#8211;133&lt;/ref&gt; While archbishop, Ealdred built at [[Beverley]], expanding on the building
projects begun by his predecessor Cynesige,&lt;ref name=Huscroft46&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; as
well as repairing and expanding other churches in his diocese.&lt;ref name=Edward198/&gt; He also built refectories for
the canons at York and Southwell.&lt;ref name=Darlington404&gt;Darlington "Ecclesiastical Reform" ''English Historical

Conqueror silver coin.jpg|thumb|right|A penny from the time of William I|alt=Coin image of a crowned male head with a

1066, although the [[Normans|Norman]] chroniclers mention Stigand as the officiating prelate.&lt;ref name=Hindley335/&gt;
Given Ealdred's known support of Godwin's family, John of Worcester is probably correct.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Stigand's
position as archbishop was canonically suspect, and as earl Harold had not allowed Stigand to consecrate one of the
earl's churches, it is unlikely that Harold would have allowed Stigand to perform the much more important royal
coronation.&lt;ref name=Rex199&gt;Rex ''Harold'' pp. 199&#8211;200&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments for Stigand having performed
the coronation, however, rely on the fact that no other English source names the ecclesiastic who performed the
ceremony; all Norman sources name Stigand as the presider.&lt;ref name=BarlowChurch60&gt;Barlow ''English Church 1000&#8211;1066''

king.&lt;ref name=Harold132/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harold117&gt;Walker ''Harold'' p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Ealdred perhaps
accompanied Harold when the new king went to York and secured the support of the northern magnates shortly after
Harold's consecration.&lt;ref name=Douglas183&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; According to the
medieval chronicler [[Geoffrey Gaimar]], after the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]] Harold entrusted the loot gained from
[[Harald III of Norway|Harold Hardrada]] to Ealdred.&lt;ref name=Lawson42n93&gt;Lawson ''Battle of Hastings'' p. 42
footnote 93&lt;/ref&gt; Gaimar asserts that King Harold did this because he had heard of Duke William's landing in
England, and needed to rush south to counter it.&lt;ref name=Lawson75&gt;Lawson ''Battle of Hastings'' p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;
After the Battle of Hastings, Ealdred joined the group who tried to elevate Edgar the &#198;theling, Edward the Exile's
son, as king, but eventually he submitted to William the Conqueror at [[Berkhamsted]].&lt;ref name=Huscroft19&gt;Huscroft

John of Worcester says that the group supporting Edgar vacillated over what to do while William ravaged the countryside,&lt;ref

[[Christmas|Christmas Day]] 1066.&lt;ref name=Powell1&gt;Powell and Wallis ''House of Lords'' p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; An
innovation in William's coronation ceremony was that before the actual crowning, Ealdred asked the assembled crowd, in
English, if it was their wish that William be crowned king. The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Coutances|Bishop of

that was performed at Matilda's coronation may have been composed by Ealdred himself for the occasion.&lt;ref
name=Queen183&gt;Stafford ''Queen Emma &amp; Queen Edith'' p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; In 1069, when the northern [[thegn]]s
rebelled against William and attempted to install Edgar the &#198;theling as king, Ealdred continued to support William.&lt;ref
name=Williams32/&gt; He was the only northern leader to support William, however.&lt;ref name=Kapelle109&gt;Kapelle
''Norman Conquest of the North'' p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; Ealdred was back at York by 1069. He died there on 11 September
1069,&lt;ref name=Handbook224/&gt; and his body was buried in his episcopal cathedral. He may have taken an active part
in trying to calm the rebellions in the north in 1068 and 1069.&lt;ref name=Powell13/&gt; The medieval chronicler
William of Malmesbury records a story that when the new sheriff of Worcester, Urse d'Abetot, encroached on the cemetery
of the cathedral chapter for [[Worcester Cathedral]], Ealdred pronounced a rhyming curse on him, saying "Thou are called
Urse. May you have God's curse."&lt;ref name=QBates153&gt;Quoted in Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 153. The exact
sentence in Bates is "Urse's refusal to move it drew a poetic Old English curse from the archbishop, which began "Thou
are called Urse. May you have God's curse.""&lt;/ref&gt; ==Legacy== After Ealdred's death, one of the restraints on
William's treatment of the English was removed.&lt;ref name=Barlow57/&gt; Ealdred was one of a few native Englishmen who
William appears to have trusted, and his death led to fewer attempts to integrate Englishmen into the administration,
although such efforts did not entirely stop.&lt;ref name=Bates156&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1070, a church council was held at Westminster and a number of bishops were deposed. By 1073 there were only two
Englishmen in episcopal sees, and by the time of William's death in 1087, there was only one, Wulfstan II of Worcester.&lt;ref
name=Barlow57&gt;Barlow ''English Church, 1066&#8211;1154'' p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Ealdred did much to restore discipline in
the monasteries and churches under his authority,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Barlow122/&gt; and was liberal with
gifts to the churches of his diocese. He built the monastic church of St Peter at [[Gloucester]] (now [[Gloucester
Cathedral]], though nothing of his fabric remains), then part of his diocese of Worcester. He also repaired a large part
of [[Beverley Minster]] in the diocese of York, adding a [[Presbytery (architecture)|presbytery]] and an unusually
splendid painted ceiling covering "all the upper part of the church from the choir to the tower{{nbsp}}...intermingled
with gold in various ways, and in a wonderful fashion".&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell ''Anglo-Saxon Art'' p. 93, quoting the
''Chronica Ecclesiae Eboracensis'' (York chronicle). None of these works remain.&lt;/ref&gt; He added a pulpit "in
German style" of bronze, gold and silver, surmounted by an arch with a [[rood]] cross in the same materials; these were
examples of the lavish decorations added to important churches in the years before the conquest.&lt;ref name=Edward198/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell
''Anglo-Saxon Art'' p. 65 and note 151 on pp. 264&#8211;265&lt;/ref&gt; Ealdred encouraged Folcard, a monk of
[[Canterbury Cathedral|Canterbury]], to write the ''Life'' of Saint [[John of Beverley]].&lt;ref name=DNBJB&gt;Palliser
"John of Beverley (St John of Beverley) (d. 721)" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; This was part
of Ealdred's promotion of the cult of Saint John,&lt;ref name=Blair314&gt;Blair ''Church in Anglo-Saxon Society'' p. 314&lt;/ref&gt;
who had only been canonised in 1037. Along with the ''Pontificale'', Ealdred may have brought back from Cologne the
first manuscript of the ''[[Cambridge Songs]]'' to enter England, a collection of Latin [[Goliard]]ic songs which became
famous in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=ASEnc&gt;Lapidge "Ealdred" ''Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England'' p.
153&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Michael Lapidge suggests that the ''Laudes Regiae'', which are included in Cotton
Vitellius E xii, might have been composed by Ealdred, or a member of his household. Another historian, H. J. Cowdrey,
argued that the ''laudes'' were composed at Winchester. These praise songs are probably the same performed at Matilda's
coronation, but might have been used at other court ceremonies before Ealdred's death.&lt;ref name=Cotton16&gt;Lapidge
"Ealdred of York" ''Yorkshire Archaeological Journal'' pp. 16&#8211;18&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have seen Ealdred as an
"old-fashioned prince-bishop".&lt;ref name=Loyn62&gt;Loyn ''English Church'' p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Others say he "raised the
see of York from its former rustic state".&lt;ref name=QHarper168&gt;Harper-Bill "Anglo-Norman Church" ''Companion to
the Anglo-Norman World'' p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; He was known for his generosity and for his diplomatic and administrative
abilities.&lt;ref name=Loyn62/&gt; After the Conquest, Ealdred provided a degree of continuity between the pre- and
post-Conquest worlds.&lt;ref name=Loyn67&gt;Loyn ''English Church'' p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; One modern historian feels that it
was Ealdred who was behind the compilation of the D version of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', and gives a date in the
1050s as its composition.&lt;ref name=Lawson62fn34&gt;Lawson ''Battle of Hastings'' p. 62 footnote 34&lt;/ref&gt;
Certainly, Ealdred is one of the leading figures in the work, and it is likely that one of his clerks compiled the
version.&lt;ref name=Wormald130&gt;Wormald ''Making of English Law'' pp. 130&#8211;131&lt;/ref&gt; ==Notes==

L., ''Philip of Macedon'', Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1994, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; As the son of [[Neoptolemus I of Epirus|Neoptolemus I]] and brother of [[Olympias]], Alexander I was an uncle of [[Alexander the Great]]. He was also an uncle of [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]].  ==Life== [[Neoptolemus I of Epirus|Neoptolemus I]] ruled jointly with his brother [[Arybbas of Epirus|Arybbas]]. When Neoptolemus died in c. 357 BC, his son Alexander was only a child and Arrybas became the sole king.  In c. 350 BC, Alexander was brought to the court of [[Philip II of Macedon]] in order to protect him. In 342/3 in his late 20s, Philip made him king of Epirus, after dethroning his uncle Arybbas.&lt;ref name="Ellis"/&gt;  When Olympias was repudiated by her husband in 337 BC, she went to her brother, and endeavoured to induce him to make war on Philip. Alexander, however, declined the contest, and formed a second alliance with Philip by agreeing to marry the daughter of Philip (Alexander's niece) [[Cleopatra of Macedonia|Cleopatra]]. During the wedding in 336 BC, Philip was assassinated by [[Pausanias of Orestis]].  In 334&amp;nbsp;BC, Alexander I, at the request of the Greek colony of [[Taranto|Taras]] (in [[Magna Graecia]]), crossed over into [[Italy]], to aid them in battle against several [[Ancient Italic peoples|Italic tribes]], including the [[Lucanians]] and [[Bruttii]]. After a victory over the [[Samnium|Samnites]] and Lucanians near [[Paestum]] in 332&amp;nbsp;BC, he made a treaty with the [[Roman Republic|Romans]]. He then took [[Heraclea (Lucania)|Heraclea]] from the Lucanians, and [[Terina (ancient city)|Terina]] and [[Siponto|Sipontum]] from the Bruttii. Through the treachery of some Lucanian exiles, he was compelled to engage under unfavourable circumstances in the [[Battle of Pandosia]] and was killed by a Lucanian. He left a son, [[Neoptolemus II of Epirus|Neoptolemus]], and a daughter, Cadmea.&lt;ref&gt;[[Junianus Justinus|Justin]].

He was also an uncle of [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]].  ==Life== [[Neoptolemus I of Epirus|Neoptolemus I]] ruled jointly with his brother [[Arybbas of Epirus|Arybbas]]. When Neoptolemus died in c. 357 BC, his son Alexander was only a child and Arrybas became the sole king.  In c. 350 BC, Alexander was brought to the court of [[Philip II of Macedon]] in order to protect him. In 342/3 in his late 20s, Philip made him king of Epirus, after dethroning his uncle Arybbas.&lt;ref name="Ellis"/&gt;  When Olympias was repudiated by her husband in 337 BC, she went to her brother, and endeavoured to induce him to make war on Philip. Alexander, however, declined the contest, and formed a second alliance with Philip by agreeing to marry the daughter of Philip (Alexander's niece) [[Cleopatra of Macedonia|Cleopatra]]. During the wedding in 336 BC, Philip was assassinated by [[Pausanias of Orestis]].  In 334&amp;nbsp;BC, Alexander I, at the request of the Greek colony of [[Taranto|Taras]] (in [[Magna Graecia]]), crossed over into [[Italy]], to aid them in battle against several [[Ancient Italic peoples|Italic tribes]], including the [[Lucanians]] and [[Bruttii]]. After a victory over the [[Samnium|Samnites]] and Lucanians near [[Paestum]] in 332&amp;nbsp;BC, he made a treaty with the [[Roman Republic|Romans]]. He then took [[Heraclea (Lucania)|Heraclea]] from the Lucanians, and [[Terina (ancient city)|Terina]] and [[Siponto|Sipontum]] from the Bruttii. Through the treachery of some Lucanian exiles, he was compelled to engage under unfavourable circumstances in the [[Battle of Pandosia]] and was killed by a Lucanian.

Alexander defeated [[Demetrius I Soter]] for the crown in 150 BC. Ruling briefly, he lost the crown to [[Demetrius II
Nicator]] during his defeat at the [[Battle of Antioch (145 BC)]] in Syria, dying shortly after. ==Life== ===Origins and
mission to Rome=== Alexander Balas claimed to be the son of [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] and [[Laodice IV]] and heir to
the Seleucid throne. The ancient sources, [[Polybius]] and [[Diodorus]] say that this claim was false and that he and
his sister [[Laodice VI]] were really natives of [[&#304;zmir|Smyrna]] of humble origin.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius 33.18.5-18;
Diodorus ''Bibliotheca'' 31.32a.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars disagree about whether this is true or was propaganda put
about by Alexander's opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chrubasik |first1=Boris |title=Kings and Usurpers in the

candidate for the Seleucid throne by [[Attalus II]] of [[Pergamum]]. Attalus had been disturbed by the Seleucid king
Demetrius I's interference in [[Cappadocia]], where he had dethroned king [[Ariarathes V]].&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus
''Bibliotheca'' 31.32a&lt;/ref&gt; Boris Chrubasik is sceptical, noting that there is little subsequent evidence for
Attalid involvement with Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chrubasik |first1=Boris |title=Kings and Usurpers in

presented Alexander to the [[Roman Senate]], which recognised him as the legitimate Seleucid king and agreed to support
him in his bid to take the throne. Polybius mentions that Attalus II and Demetrius I also met with the Senate at this

was then poisoned by another brother, Alexander. Alexander governed tyrannically and was constantly seeking to control
[[Thessaly]] and the kingdom of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]]. He also engaged in piratical raids on
[[Attica]]. Alexander was murdered by the brothers of his wife, Thebe, as it was said that she lived in fear of her
husband and hated Alexander's cruel and brutal character. ==Reign== The accounts of how Alexander came to power vary
somewhat in minor points. [[Diodorus Siculus]] tells us that upon the assassination of the tyrant [[Jason of Pherae]],
in 370 BC, his brother Polydorus ruled for a year, but he was then poisoned by Alexander, another brother.&lt;ref
name="ds"&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], xv. 60-61&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to [[Xenophon]], Polydorus was murdered by
his brother Polyphron, who was, in turn,&lt;ref name="xh"&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Hellenica]]'' vi. 4. ~ 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This
date is at variance with [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (vi. 5)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wess"&gt;Wesseling, ''On
[[Diodorus Siculus]]'' xv. 75&lt;/ref&gt; murdered by his nephew Alexander &#8212;son of Jason, in 369 BC. [[Plutarch]]
relates that Alexander worshipped the spear he slew his uncle with as if it were a god.&lt;ref name="wess"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]],
''Pelop.'' p. 293, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander governed tyrannically, and according to [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]],&lt;ref
name="ds"/&gt; differently from the former rulers, but Polyphron, at least, seems to have set him the example.&lt;ref
name="xh"/&gt; The states of [[Thessaly]], which had previously acknowledged the authority of [[Jason of Pherae]],&lt;ref
name="ds"/&gt; were not so willing to submit to Alexander the tyrant, (especially the old family of the [[Aleuadae]] of
[[Larissa]], who had most reason to fear him). Therefore, they applied for help from [[Alexander II of Macedon]].
Alexander prepared to meet his enemy in [[Macedon]]ia, but the king anticipated him, and, reaching [[Larissa]], was
admitted into the city. Alexander withdrew to [[Pherae]] whilst the Macedonian King placed a garrison in Larissa, as
well as in [[Crannon]], which had also come over to him.&lt;ref name="ds"/&gt; But once the bulk of the Macedonian army
had retired, the states of Thessaly feared the return and vengeance of Alexander, and so sent for aid to [[Thebes
(Greece)|Thebes]], whose policy it was to put a check on any neighbour who might otherwise become too formidable. Thebes
accordingly dispatched [[Pelopidas]] to the aid of Thessaly. On arrival of Pelopidas at Larissa, whence according to
Diodorus, he dislodged the Macedonian garrison, Alexander presented himself and offered submission. When Pelopidas
expressed indignation at the tales of Alexander's profligacy and cruelty, Alexander took alarm and fled.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus
Siculus]], xv. 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plut"&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Pelop.'' p. 291-297, d.&lt;/ref&gt; These events
appear to refer to the early part of 368 BC. In the summer of that year Pelopidas was again sent into [[Thessaly]], in
consequence of fresh complaints against Alexander. Accompanied by [[Ismenias]], he went merely as a negotiator, without
any military force, and was seized by Alexander and thrown into prison.&lt;ref name="plut"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ds2"&gt;[[Diodorus
Siculus]], xv. 71-75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Polybius]], viii. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The scholar [[William Mitford]] suggested
that Pelopidas was taken prisoner in battle, but the language of [[Demosthenes]] hardly supports such an inference.&lt;ref
name="demo"&gt;[[Demosthenes]], ''Against Aristocrates'' p. 660&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Mitford]], ''History of
Greece'' ch. 27. sec. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The Thebans sent a large army into Thessaly to rescue Pelopidas, but they could not
keep the field against the superior cavalry of Alexander, who, aided by auxiliaries from [[Athens]], pursued them with
great slaughter. The destruction of the whole Theban army is said to only have been averted by the ability of
[[Epaminondas]], who was serving in the campaign, but not as general. In 367 BC Alexander carried out a massacre of the
citizens of [[Scotussa]].&lt;ref name="plut"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ds2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]],
''Description of Greece'' vi. 5&lt;/ref&gt; A fresh Theban expedition into [[Thessaly]], under [[Epaminondas]] resulted,
according to [[Plutarch]], in a three-year truce and the release of prisoners, including Pelopidas.&lt;ref name="plut"/&gt;&lt;ref
name="ds2"/&gt; During the next three years, Alexander seemed to renew his attempts to subdue the states of Thessaly,
especially [[Magnesia (regional unit)|Magnesia]] and [[Phthiotis]],&lt;ref name="plut"/&gt; for upon the expiry of the
truce, in 364 BC, they again applied to Thebes for protection from him. The Theban army under Pelopidas is said to have
been dismayed by an [[eclipse]] (on 13 July 364 BC, see [[List of solar eclipses in the 4th century BC|4th century BC
eclipses]]), and Pelopidas, leaving the bulk of his army behind, entered Thessaly at the head of three hundred volunteer
horsemen and some mercenaries. At [[Battle of Cynoscephalae (364 BC)|Cynoscephalae]], the Thebans defeated Alexander,
but Pelopidas was killed.&lt;ref name="plut"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ds3"&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], xv. 80&lt;/ref&gt; This was
closely followed by another Theban victory under Malcites and Diogiton. Alexander was then forced to restore the
conquered towns to the Thessalians, confine himself to Pherae, join the [[Boeotian League]], and become a dependent ally
of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]].&lt;ref name="xh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="plut"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ds3"/&gt; If the death of
[[Epaminondas]] in 362 freed Athens from fear of Thebes, it appears at the same time to have exposed it to further
aggression from Alexander, who made a piratical raid on [[Tinos]] and other cities of the [[Cyclades]], plundering them,
and making slaves of the inhabitants. He also besieged [[Peparethus]], and "even landed troops in Attica itself, and
seized the port of [[Panormus (Attica)|Panormus]], a little eastward of [[Sounion]]." The Athenian admiral
[[Leosthenes]] defeated Alexander and managed to relieve Peparethus, but Alexander escaped from being blockaded in
Panormus, took several Attic [[trireme]]s, and plundered the [[Piraeus]].&lt;ref name="wess"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus
Siculus]], xv. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Polyaenus]], vi. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]], ''c. Polycl.'' pp.
1207-1208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Connop Thirlwall]], ''History of Greece'' vol. v. p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; ==Death== The
murder of Alexander is assigned by [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] to 357/356. [[Plutarch]] gives a detailed account of
it, with a lively picture of the palace. Guards watched throughout the night, except at Alexander's bedchamber, which
was at the top of a ladder with a ferocious chained dog guarding the door. Thebe, Alexander's wife and cousin (or
half-sister, as the daughter of [[Jason of Pherae]]),&lt;ref name="plut"/&gt; concealed her three brothers in the house
during the day, had the dog removed when Alexander had gone to rest, and, having covered the steps of the ladder with
wool, brought up the young men to her husband's chamber. Though she had taken away Alexander's sword, they feared to set
about the deed until she threatened to wake him. Her brothers then entered and killed Alexander. His body was cast into
the streets, and exposed to every indignity. Of Thebe's motive for the murder different accounts are given. [[Plutarch]]
states it to have been fear of her husband, together with hatred of Alexander's cruel and brutal character, and ascribes
these feelings principally to the representations of Pelopidas, when she visited him in his prison. In [[Cicero]] the
deed is ascribed to jealousy. Other accounts have it that Alexander had taken Thebe's youngest brother as his
[[eromenos]] and tied him up. Exasperated by his wife's pleas to release the youth, he murdered the boy, which drove her
to revenge.&lt;ref name="plut"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], xvi. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]],
''[[Hellenica]]'' vi. 4. ~ 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[De Officiis]]'' 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]],
''[[De Inventione]]'' ii. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristot. ''ap. [[Cicero]] [[De Divinatione|de Div.]] i. 25; the dream
of Eudemus&lt;/ref&gt; ==Other== It is written in [[Plutarch]]'s Second Oration On the Fortune or the Virtue of
Alexander the Great (see ''[[Moralia]]''), and in [[Claudius Aelianus]]' [[Claudius Aelianus#Varia Historia|''Varia
Historia'']] that Alexander left a tragedy in a theatre because he did not wish to weep at fiction when unmoved by his
own cruelty.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, trans. Henry Chadwick. Confessions. Oxford: Oxford UP, 1991. Page 15. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
This suggests that while Alexander was a tyrant, perhaps his iron heart could be softened. The actor was threatened with
punishment because Alexander was so moved while watching.&lt;ref&gt;Aelianus Varia Historia xiv. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was, however, dispossessed of both [[Macedon]] and [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] by [[Demetrius II of Macedon]], the son of Antigonus II; upon which he took refuge amongst the [[Acarnania]]ns. By their assistance and that of his own subjects, who entertained a great attachment for him, he recovered Epirus. It appears that he was in alliance with the [[Aetolia]]ns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Alexander II.

On the death of Alexander, around 242 BC, Olympias assumed the regency on behalf of her sons, and married Phthia to Demetrius.&lt;ref&gt;''Universal Pronouncing Dictionary of Biography and Mythology'', by Joseph Thomas - 1908 - page 90&lt;/ref&gt;  There are extant silver and copper coins of this king.
